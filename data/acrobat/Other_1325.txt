A 31-year old male patient presented to the Emergency Department of a referral hospital, complaining of sudden onset of abdominal pain. The patient was moderately hypertensive and required continuous infusion of nicardipine hydrochloride to control blood pressure. The patient's abdomen was diffusely tender with mild firmness.
The patient was referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of contained rupture of huge abdominal visceral aneurysms. Computed tomography (CT) and 3D CT angiography revealed huge aneurysms with a cyst-like or beaded appearance along the coeliac axis to the proper hepatic and splenic artery ( â€“C). This finding was accompanied by extravasation of contrast media, suggesting contained rupture . Arterial inflow to the upper abdominal viscera was from the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery . Visceral aneurysms were too enormous to be treated with endovascular coil embolization, and surgical approaches with a low risk of intraoperative sudden rupture were chosen. This strategy was a hybrid operation with the following steps: aorto-superior mesenteric artery (SMA) bypass grafting followed by aortic endografting, distal splenopancreatectomy and en bloc resection of the visceral aneurysms.

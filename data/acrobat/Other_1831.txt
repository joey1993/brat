A 67-year-old man underwent tooth extraction because he had noticed spontaneous bleeding from the gingiva in association with tooth instability. After the tooth extraction was performed in the Department of Clinical Oral Oncology in our hospital, intermittent hemorrhage continued, and his oral cavity was almost completely filled with a blood clot, even though local hemostatic treatments were performed along with the cessation of aspirin for the secondary prevention of ischemic heart disease. The dentists consulted us four days after the tooth extraction because the man was our outpatient in the Department of Cardiology. He had been diagnosed to have chronic DIC due to an abdominal aortic aneurysm 7 months earlier although he had not had any hemorrhagic events since then. At that time, his laboratory data were as follows: platelet count, 48,000/μL; prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR), 1.15; activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 37.2 s (normal range: 25.2-34.4 s); fibrinogen, 93 mg/dL (normal range: 168-329 mg/dL); fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), 46.9 μg/mL (normal range: <5 μg/mL); D-dimer, 16.0 μg/mL (normal range: <1 μg/mL); antithrombin III (ATIII), 87% (normal range: 75-125%); protein C, 62% (normal range: 70-140%); protein S, 76% (normal range: 60-150%); thrombinantithrombin complex (TAT), 33 ng/mL (normal range: <3.0 ng/mL); α2-plasmin inhibitor, 29% (normal range: 80120%); plasmin-α2-plasmin inhibitor complex (α2-PI); and 10.6 μg/mL (normal range: <0.8 μg/mL). However, he and his family did not agree to surgery because they worried about the complications of the operation given his concomitant illnesses. His past medical history included cerebral hemorrhage due to hypertension at 49 years of age, acute myocardial infarction and coronary bypass surgery at 56 years of age, alveolar hemorrhage with acute pneumonia at 59 years of age, transient ischemic attack at 64 years of age, and hemorrhagic gastric ulcer at 65 years of age. His mother died of cerebral infarction, and his elder sister died of myocardial infarction. His medications included carvedilol (20 mg), enalapril (5 mg), furosemide (40 mg), spironolactone (25 mg), nitrate (20 mg) for heart failure due to old myocardial infarction, esomeprazole (20 mg) for the prevention of gastric ulcer, and aspirin for the prevention of ischemic heart disease, at a dose of 100 mg every two days because he had ecchymosis. Although he was found to have atrial fibrillation at 58 years of age, he did not agree to take anticoagulant therapy because of his history of severe hemorrhagic events. His CHA2DS2VASc score was 6 (CHADS2 score of 4), and his HAS-BLED score was 4, which indicated a high risk of bleeding. On admission, his blood pressure was 115/75 mm Hg, his pulse rate was 57/min and irregular, and a Levine grade II systolic murmur was heard at the apex. Subcutaneous hemorrhage was seen on both arms. Electrocardiography showed atrial fibrillation. A chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly with a cardiothoracic ratio of 60%. Echocardiography demonstrated mild left ventricular hypertrophy and diffuse hypokinesis, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 55%. Contrastenhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated an abdominal aortic aneurysm from the ostium of the superior mesenteric artery to the bifurcation of the common iliac artery (maximal diameter, 62 mm) . His laboratory data were as follows: white blood cell count, 5,100×, and he was discharged, after which, his condition remained stable for 6 months. ATIII was around 80% during admission and after discharge. Although TAT and α2-PI levels were not measured during admission, TAT was around 10 ng/mL, and α2-PI was around 60% from 1 to 6 months after discharge. These values improved compared to the previous levels at the time of diagnosis of chronic DIC without rivaroxaban (TAT, 33 ng/mL; α2-PI, 29%).

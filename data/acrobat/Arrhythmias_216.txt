A 47-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department of the hospital for a voluntary intoxication: 280 mg of ivabradine (56 Ã‚ 5 mg tablets) associated (not proved) with an unknown dose of bromazepam. He presented drowsiness and a mild sinusal bradycardia (50 bpm) associated with a well-tolerated low blood pressure at 100/50 mmHg. No abnormality was found on the successive electrocardiograms, with the exception of a sinusal bradycardia. Initial treatment consisted of just one injection of atropine (1 mg) and a gastric wash. The patient was kept under medical supervision for 48 h before psychiatric care. No complication was noted, and the patient left the emergency department on Day 3. A blood sample was collected 1.5 h after the intoxication for ivabradine determination. It is of note that the hypothesis of a bromazepam intake by the patient was not investigated by the clinicians as from their clinical point of view and in the presented case, such benzodiazepine intoxication only required monitoring, without any specific dispositions.

A 30-year-old female was diagnosed with AML in January 2004. At that time laboratory data were as follows: hemoglobin (Hb) 97 g/l, platelets 29×10 9 /l, white blood cell count (WBC) 17.9×10 9 /l, with 74% of myeloblasts in differential leukocyte formula. Liver function tests showed elevated values for aspartate transaminase 55 U/l, alanine transaminase 59 U/l, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-3) 451 U/l. Other biochemical find ings were within normal limits. Myocardial function, electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray were normal. The bone marrow aspirate showed hypercellularity with 74% of myeloblasts, which were myeloperoxidase-positive, with oval, cleaved nuclei, so that the cytology was in full correlation with AML with maturation. Flow immunocytometry of bone marrow mononuclear cells detected the following immunophenotype: (HLA-DR, CD117, CD33, CD13, CD15, and CD64) + that was also in accordance with the diagnosis of AML with maturation. Cytogenetic analysis: 45X,-X, t (8; 21) (q22; q22), del (9) (q22)
/46,XX . The patient was submitted to the induction cycle of ADE scheme of chemotherapy according to AML MRC 12 regimen in the following doses: doxorubicin 60 mg on D1 (D-day), D3 and D5 iv, cytarabine 2×140 mg iv from D1 to D8 in bolus, and etoposide 140 mg in one-hour infusion from D1 to D5. After the induction therapy the patient achieved a complete remission. In May 2004 the patient was submitted to consolidation chemotherapy, and developed hepatosplenic candidiasis after-wards. A full recovery was achieved after six months of antimycotic treatment with fluconazole, amphotericin B, voriconazole and itraconazole. In September 2004 she was submitted to the second consolidation cycle ( regimen MACE – composed of amsacrine 15 mg iv from D1 to D5, cytarabine 2×150 mg iv continuous infusion from D1 to D5, and etoposide 150 mg iv from D1 to D5). During the treatment she was given fluconazole. In November 2004 she received the MiDAC regimen (mitoxantrone 15 mg iv from D1 to D4, and cytarabine 3 g iv from D1 to D3). Thus, she received a total dose of 360 mg of doxorubicin and 60 mg of mitoxantrone. She achieved a complete remission and stayed in remission ever since. Five years after the diagnosis of AML she was well and became pregnant. In 2009 she successfully delivered a healthy child by caesarean section. After delivery she was without complaints and hematological laboratory data were within normal limits. Seven months later, she again became pregnant and delivered a healthy child in January 2011, again by caesarean section. Seven days later she became febrile and experienced first signs of heart failure (shortness of breath, legs edema, and cough). She was hypotensive (85/60 mmHg), with sinus tachycardia (105 beats per minute), and as a consequence she was admitted to the emergency cardiac unit. Physical finding also included gallop rhythm and enlarged liver. X-rays showed enlarged heart and small pleural effusion. ECG revealed sinus rhythm, low voltage, negative T in V4–6, D2, D3, aVF . As the patient was in life-threatening condition, she was immediately transferred to the tertiary institution (Department of Cardiology of the Clinical Center of Serbia) for evaluation and treatment. Echocardiography showed hypokinetic left ventricle 52/42 mm with movable thrombotic mass 12 mm in diameter attached to the lateral wall. Mitral insufficiency was estimated to 3+, into the enlarged left atrium (44×50×40 mm). Tricuspid insufficiency 2+ gave systolic pressure in the right ventricle of 47–50 mmHg. Laboratory data were as follows: Hb 152 g/l, platelets 190×10 9 /l, WBC 8.1×10 9 /l, urea 15.2 mmol/l, creatinine 131 umol/l, aspartate transaminase 234 raised to 571 U/l, glutamic pyruvic transaminase 193, which raised to 1,904 U/l, alkaline phosphatase 432 U/l, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 120 U/l, C-reactive protein 13.2 mg/l, fibrinogen 4.6 g/l, D-dimer 27 ug/l. Brain natriuretic peptide reached level of 3,196 pg/ ml with further decrease to 1,388 pg/ml (upper reference value 100 pg/ml). The patient was treated with dobutamine, unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparin, diuretics, cardiotonics, beta-blockers and antiplatelet therapy. She was also treated with bromocriptine, which had to be discontinued because the patient developed very serious side effects such as nausea, vomiting and somnolence. After six weeks of treatment, her clinical condition improved, resulting in left ventricular ejection fraction of 25–30% at discharge. In September 2013, clinical findings showed the patient in complete remission of leukemia without signs of heart failure, normal findings on chest radiography, in sinus rhythm and echocardiography showing left ventricular ejection fraction of 54%. At present she is symptom-free and in complete remission of AML.

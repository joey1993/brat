Clinical Presentation and Imaging A 66-year-old man presented with repeated episodes of syncope and loss of consciousness that occurred with head rotation. A CT scan demonstrated extradural vertebral artery compression by the occipital bone and posterior arch of C-1. The compression was exacerbated when the patient turned his head, causing the symptoms. Cerebral angiography confirmed these findings, demonstrating bilateral occlusion of the vertebral arteries at the V 3 segment upon head rotation .
Clinical Presentation and Imaging A 53-year-old woman presented with worsening headaches, forgetfulness, and a recent decline in her work performance. MRI demonstrated a 4-cm, enhancing, duralbased mass over the right temporal lobe with internal gradient susceptibility, consistent with a meningioma with areas of calcification . Because of these findings, the patient agreed to the recommendation that she undergo a right temporal craniotomy for resection of the mass.

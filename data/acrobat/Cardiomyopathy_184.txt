Within a few hours, the clinical status of the patient deteriorated progressively and she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with the chief complaint of febrile respiratory failure. Routine echocardiography on admission to the ICU documented a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10%, complemented by febrile temperatures of 40.1Â°C and disturbance of consciousness. While invasive blood pressure ranged between normo-and hypertensive, peripheral vasodilators were administered and attempts were made to stabilize respiratory function by non-invasive ventilation (NIV-CPAP). After unsatisfactory stabilization, a Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted. Within the next hours, the patient suffered from progressive respiratory deterioration and was put on invasive ventilation (BiPAP), but this was complicated by sudden cardiac arrest shortly after the otherwise uncomplicated and successful orotracheal intubation. After failure to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), within the next 30 minutes extracorporeal cardio-pulmonary resuscitation was instituted by means of peripheral veno-arterial ECMO and intraaortic counterpulsation leading to ROSC. A tensionpneumothorax possibly because of the prolonged chest compressions was drained by a chest tube after ROSC. Nevertheless, and despite additional extensive supportive therapy, the patient died within the following 24 hours as a result of multiorgan dysfunction. To investigate the possible clinical diagnosis of a fulminant myocarditis leading to a dramatic low-output failure, an autopsy was performed. The heart was found to be hyperthrophic (IVS 21 mm), but otherwise not infiltrated and

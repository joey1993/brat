A 57-year-old woman presented with bone pain in May 1999. She was diagnosed with IgG-k MM with a serum M-protein of 43.6 g/L, urine k light chains of 116 mg per 24 hours, 12% bone marrow plasma cells, and lytic bone lesions. Her blood counts showed a neutrophil count of 0.3 3 10 9 /L, with normal hemoglobin and platelet count. Due to severe neutropenia, no alkylating agents were administered and the patient was treated with 6 courses of VBAD and ASCT followed by a2b-interferon maintenance achieving CR in February 2001, with normalization of her neutrophil count. In October 2002, the patient developed PD withFor personal use only. on April 6, 2017. by guest www.bloodjournal.org From spontaneous rib fracture and neutropenia of 0.5 3 10 9 /L. The patient received rescue therapy with single-agent thalidomide at a dose up to 400 mg per day achieving a decrease in her serum M-protein from 45 to 15 g/L and normalization in her neutrophil count. However, 10 months later, thalidomide was discontinued due to grade 2 peripheral neuropathy. In June 2005, a new progression was documented with a serum M-protein of 33 g/L and a neutrophil count of 0.6 3 10 9 /L. Single-agent IV bortezomib at a reduced dose of 1 mg/m 2 was initiated because of thalidomide-related grade 1 peripheral neuropathy. After 2 cycles, the serum M-protein increased to 48.6 g/L with decreasing neutropenia to 0.13 3 10 9 /L with no worsening in her peripheral neuropathy. The dose of bortezomib was increased at 1.3 mg/m 2 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 3 times per week was started. The patient achieved PR with a decrease in her serum M-protein to 14 g/L and normal white cell count at bortezomib discontinuation after 6 full-dose cycles. Nine months later, in November 2006, a new increase in her serum M-protein to 46 g/L as well as recurrent neutropenia were observed. Retreatment with 8 courses of full-dose bortezomib plus G-CSF resulted in a new PR with M-protein decrease to 21 g/L and neutropenia resolution. Seven months later, in October 2007, the patient experienced a new progression with a serum M-protein increase to 40 g/L. At this time, the patient was treated with LenDex achieving PR with an M-protein decrease to 11 g/L. The patient was continued on LenDex therapy for 3 years and remained in PR until October 2010 when she developed PD and died in May 2011 .

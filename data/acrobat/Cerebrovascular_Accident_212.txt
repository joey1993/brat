A patient with a medical history significant for longstanding lower back pain on chronic narcotics for pain control was admitted to our hospital due to altered content of consciousness after a suicide attempt at home. The patient ingested high doses of oxycodone and contacted emergency services immediately. Patient developed mild altered sensorium and confusion without loss of consciousness, cardiac or respiratory arrest following drug-overdose. Comprehensive laboratory investigations were negative except for the presence of opioids in urine and serum along with trace cannabinoids. No other toxic exposures were documented. Brain MRI scan obtained within the first 24 h after the event showed symmetric areas of restricted diffusion in bilateral globus pallidus interna and both hippocampi concerning for acute ischaemia . No other structural abnormalities were noted including thalamic, brainstem, periaqueductal or periventricular grey matter lesions. Testing for toxins known to cause direct, symmetric injury to pallidum including barbiturates, methanol, cyanide, carbon monoxide and cocaine were negative. Furthermore, thiamine levels on admission were within normal limits. The patient remained haemodynamically stable during hospitalisation. However, over the following week, the patient exhibited a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterised by impaired attention, apathy, short-term memory, impaired semantic memory and reduced spontaneity. The remainder of their neurological examination was normal.

A 35-year old man consults for palpitations and worsening dyspnoea. He had no relevant personal or family medical history. Clinical examination did not reveal any signs of right heart failure; only a systolic murmur in mitral focus could be auscultated. Electrocardiogram recorded an atrial fibrillation. Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly with large left paracardiac opacity . Echocardiography revealed dilated left ventricle with a gigantic lateral wall aneurysm without contractile motion  responsible for a severe functional mitral regurgitation. The left ventricular function was estimated at 45%. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) confirmed a large calcified aneurysm measuring 145 Ã— 100 mm, involving the free wall and communicating with the ventricular cavity by a wide collar . Coronary angiography revealed normal arteries. The inherent risks of such a large LVA are rupture, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, embolism and chronic congestive heart failure. Performing a curative surgery is the only way to prevent all these complications. The patient underwent, through a median sternotomy, intracardiac repair using routine cardiopulmonary bypass with aortic cross-clamping. We describe a large calcified LVA occupying almost the whole of the left hemithorax and adhering through the pericardium to the lung and chest wall . We used the trans-septal approach and through the mitral valve, we found a wide collar that connects the left ventricle to the aneurysm . Mitral apparatus was abnormal with annular deformity and restriction of the posterior leaflet. Aneurysmal exclusion was performed through the mitral valve by closing the collar with a Dacron patch  and mitral replacement was accomplished after failed repair judged by intraoperative transoesophageal echocardiography. At the 12-month follow-up, the patient was completely asymptomatic and there was no residual communication between aneurysm and ventricle or paraprosthetic leak.

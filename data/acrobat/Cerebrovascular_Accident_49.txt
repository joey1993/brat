A 57-year-old man presented with sudden headache associated with nausea and vomiting. His WFNS scale was I. A head CT scan revealed a diffuse SAH, Fisher grade III. His medical history revealed daily smoking but was unremarkable otherwise. CT angiography revealed a large left paraclinoid internal carotid artery aneurysm that was treated with endovascular coiling. The BOLD-MRI CVR test was obtained 36 h after SAH, 12 h after the coiling . It demonstrated impaired cerebrovascular reserve in the medial temporal and frontal lobes bilaterally, but without signs of vasospasm on the MR angiogram (MRA) and no ischemic stroke. The patient was monitored according to the protocol for SAH and 8 days later he presented with speech diffi culties and increased confusion. Triple-H therapy (hypertension, hypervolemia, and hemodilution) was initiated and another MRA was obtained, showing signifi cant vasospasm in both the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territories and an acute stroke in the mesial left temporal lobe ( , c ). The patient responded to Triple-H therapy and eventually made a good recovery despite the stroke. The vascular territories in which the vasospasm and DCI occurred had a good spatial correlation with the vascular territories that exhibited impaired CVR days before the onset of DCI.

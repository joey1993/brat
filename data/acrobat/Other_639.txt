A 50-y-old man had stage IV lung adenocarcinoma, osseous metastases on bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech) chemotherapy, and systemic anticoagulation for left calf vein thrombosis. He had a progressive increase in levels on liver function tests (alkaline phosphatase 260 , and normal total bilirubin). CT abdomen/pelvis (portal phase) demonstrated geographic areas of decreased attenuation involving the entire left hepatic lobe and segments of the posterior right hepatic lobe that were not consistent with metastases. No liver lesions suggestive of metastases were seen. The left hepatic lobe perfusion abnormality appeared secondary to left PVT. The posterior segmental abnormality was also attributed to a small-vessel portal occlusion, although no definite thrombus was seen. PET/CT images  revealed congruent intense hypermetabolic activity within the areas of hypoattenuation within the liver, suspected to be from PVT-related parenchymal inflammation or injury. Within the anterior hepatic segment, there were patchy areas of mild 18 F-FDG uptake atypical of metastases. Rising liver function levels led to ultrasoundguided biopsy of this area, which revealed metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma. For progressive liver metastatic disease and PVT, his chemotherapy was modified, with good response and improved liver function. Follow-up CT demonstrated left

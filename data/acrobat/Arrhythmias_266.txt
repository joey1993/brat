Non-invasive imaging of cardiac electrophysiology (NICE) was performed in a 61-year-old male patient with a complete left bundle branch block who underwent CRT-D implantation (Promote Quadra, St. Jude Medical) due to ischaemic heart failure. The RV lead was implanted in an apical position. For LV pacing a quadripolar LV lead (Quartet, St. Jude Medical) was placed in a posterolateral cardiac vein. During implantation adequate pacing and sensing properties were tested. At all pacing sites, a safety margin of .2Ã— pacing threshold was accepted as adequate. The pacing output was initially set to 3.5 V at 0.5 ms impulse duration at the time of implantation due to safety reasons. The patient's characterisitics are shown in .

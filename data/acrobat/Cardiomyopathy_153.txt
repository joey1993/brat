Th e patient was a 47 years-old, Caucasian female, height 157 cm, weight 55 kg, who was suspected to suff er from myotonic dystrophy-1 at 20 years of age. Already her deceased mother and sister were suspected to have had MD1 without genetic confi rmation. At onset the proband presented with ptosis and later developed clinical myotonia and weakness of the distal upper and lower limbs. In March 2012 she was able use her hands, to walk independently and to take care of herself. In August 2012 clinical neurologic examination revealed a myopathic face, mild bilateral ptosis, right-sided weakness of the tongue and weak antefl exion (M3), quadruparesis (M3) with left-sided predominance on the upper limbs and proximal predominance on the lower limbs, general wasting, clinical myotonic reaction on the upper limbs, and generally reduced tendon refl exes. Th e neurological diagnosis was established genetically post-mortem in a stored ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetate blood sample. Work-up of the sample by DNA isolation, PCR, and Southern blot aft er EcoR1 and BglII digestion revealed a heterocygous CTG-repeat expansion of 1200 – 1900 repeats in the non-translating 3 ʹ-end of the DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3. Th e remaining history was noteworthy for resection of a macro-follicular kolloidal struma in 2006, and deep venous thrombosis with consecutive bilateral pulmonary embolism aft er a fall in February 2012, initially treated with heparin and followed by dabigatran (150 mg bid) for secondary

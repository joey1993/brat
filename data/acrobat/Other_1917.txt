A 45-year-old woman with initial presentation in November 2001. The patient was diagnosed with asthma in December 1999 (41 years of age) and was treated with inhaled steroid therapy. Dyspnea and rales worsened in September 2001 (45 years of age), and she presented to our hospital in November 2001. Chest computed tomography showed bronchial wall thickening, and structures suggestive of mucous plugs were observed . P-ANCA was negative, and systemic corticosteroid therapy was started combined with montelukast and an inhaled Î²2 stimulator. In December 2003 (47 years of age), the patient developed a fever and erupplugs, with the histologic findings of the mucous plugs showing allergic mucin, but no fungal hyphae were detected. Aspergillus-specific IgE and IgG antibodies measured by the complement fixation method (8) were both negative, and a diagnosis of ABPA was not established. We instead diagnosed her as having EGPA, and she was started on PSL 40 mg/day, which resulted in an improvement of the symptoms and laboratory and radiologic findings. PSL was tapered on an outpatient basis, and in 2006 (50 years of age; PSL dose, 7 mg/day), her Aspergillus-specific IgG and IgE antibodies turned positive, and we diagnosed her as having ABPA (10). In March 2015, she is alive and continues to be followed. A 47-year-old man with initial presentation in July 1997. The patient was diagnosed as having asthma at 15 years of age. In July 1997 (47 years of age), chest abnormalshadows were found on a medical examination, and he presented to our hospital. Chest computed tomography showed structures suggestive of mucous plugs and central bronchiectasis . From August 2000 (50 years of age), Staphylococcus aureus was repeatedly isolated from his sputum, but no fungi were isolated. Laboratory tests showed increased eosinophil counts of 1,000/mm 3 and serum IgE, however, both Aspergillus-specific IgE and IgG antibodies measured by the complement fixation method (8) were negative. In February 2008 (58 years of age), we performed bronchoscopy, and A. fumigatus was isolated from the bronchial washings. Aspergillus-specific IgE and IgG antibodies turnedpositive, and we diagnosed him as having ABPA (10). P-ANCA was negative. PSL 30 mg/day was started and then tapered. In March 2014 (64 years of age; PSL 5 mg/day), he developed a fever, myalgia, and difficulty in hearing and presented to another hospital. Sinusitis and otitis media, which showed characteristic findings of AAV (11), were present, although a histologic examination was not performed. The patient then presented to our hospital, where MPOANCA was found to be positive, and we diagnosed him as having EGPA (9, 12). PSL was increased to 30 mg/day, and his auditory capacity improved. As of March 2015, he is alive and continues to be followed.

The chief complaint was loss of hearing of both ears and loss of somatosensory sensation and articulation ability. The patient was a right-handed 38-year-old man. He worked as an IT engineer for a company in Tokyo without any speech, hearing or motor disorders before the cerebrovascular accident. In 2007, he experienced rupture of a right internal carotid-posterior communicating artery (IC-PC) aneurysm and subarachnoidal hemorrhage, and subsequently lost his hearing, somatosensory sensation, and articulation ability. Because he complained of profound hearing loss, he was referred to us by a rehabilitation hospital in 2012 for further auditory study. Before he was referred to us, he underwent rehabilitation for motor dysfunction in the rehabilitation hospital for 1 year and he recovered his motor function completely. However, he did not recover his loss of hearing, somatosensory sensation, and articulation ability at all. Nevertheless, his activities of daily living (ADLs) were satisfactory and he visited us alone. He presently lives alone and works in the same company.

The episodes were initially interpreted as polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). On the basis of correlation between the tracings and episodes of near-syncope and syncope, he was thought to have idiopathic VF and was urgently referred to an electrophysiologist for consideration for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). However, because there were no established precedents or published data for using recordings from the AliveCor monitor to aid in similar clinical decisions, further evaluation was pursued prior to implantation of an ICD. An electrophysiologic study revealed spontaneous and easily inducible monomorphic VT at approximately 200 bpm from the posteroseptal right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT), which reproduced the patient's symptoms . Focal ablation in the RVOT was performed, and after ablation VT could not be reinduced. With aggressive programmed electrical stimulation, polymorphic VT and VF could not be induced either prior to or after the ablation procedure. Despite near-daily symptomatic episodes prior to the procedure, since that time the patient has had no additional episodes of syncope or presyncope and no arrhythmia detected with follow-up continuous-loop event monitoring. Importantly, the patient avoided implantation of an ICD for treatment of his condition. We hypothesize that the tracings recorded on the AliveCor monitor were runs of RVOT VT with superimposed artifact due to inconsistent contact with the AliveCor electrodes when the patient was near-syncopal. The irregularity in the tracing was likely due to a combination of artifact and variability in tachycardia cycle length at the onset of arrhythmia.

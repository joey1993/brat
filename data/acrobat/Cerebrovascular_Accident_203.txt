GC is a 50-year-old right-handed man, with 17 years of education, working as an informatics programmer in an international company. On admission to the hospital he presented acute symptoms consisting of vertigo, dizziness, and dysmetria of the left hand. Cranial MRI showed a hypo-intense lesion involving the posterior-superior portion of the left cerebellar hemisphere extending into the left portion of the bulb . When GC came to our attention, 15 days after the acute episode, neurological examination revealed a mild dysmetria of the left hand in the classical clinical testing of finger-to-nose pointing. The patient obtained normal scores on a neuropsychological assessment of general intelligence (Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices, ); memory (Rey's word list immediate and delayed recall and recognition,

, Digit span and Corsi span,
); language ; attention (Trail Making Test, ); executive functions (Wisconsin Card Sorting

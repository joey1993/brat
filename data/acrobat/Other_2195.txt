A 12 year-old boy with global neurodevelopmental delay was referred to the rheumatology clinic with worsening musculoskeletal pain and refusal to walk for two months. He also had skin eruption, restlessness and severe anemia for five months. The skin eruption started as a purpuric rash over his lower extremities that never faded away. A few courses of prednisone resulted in no improvement. Shortly after the onset of rash, he developed coombs'positive hemolytic anemia that required three transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Two months prior to his presentation to the clinic, he began refusing to walk, for which he was seen by a pediatrician and orthopedic surgeon. Radiographs showed no fracture, so physiotherapy was advised. Physiotherapy was interrupted by worsening pain and swelling over the left leg. He was seen by a neurologist after the onset of his symptoms and was given clonazepam to treat restlessness. There was no preceding history of trauma, fever, change in level of consciousness, or seizures. The patient also presented with no constitutional symptoms, no bleeding from body orifices, and no change in bowel habits. Preceding upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and gastroenterology or genitourinary symptoms were also absent. The patient was borne of a twin pregnancy that was ended at 28 weeks' gestation. Apgar at 1 and 5 min after birth was 5 and 6 respectively. He stayed ventilated in NICU for 2 months, and developed retinopathy of prematurity and retinal detachment, subsequently losing vision in the left eye. He was known to have global developmental delay with non-revealing neurological or metabolic work up. The delay had therefore been attributed to complications of prematurity. Although the family had a normal diversified diet, the child was exclusively milk-fed. He was not able to eat or chew hard food because of bad dental hygiene. Family history was unremarkable for neurological, metabolic or bleeding problems.

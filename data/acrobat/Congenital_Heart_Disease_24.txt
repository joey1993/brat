Male patient, 53 years old, presented vegetating plaque on the back of the tongue and telangiectasias on the lips, gums, palate, oral and nasal mucosa as well as on fi ngers for 10 years . He complains also of recurrent epistaxis of varying intensity ever since his childhood. Routine laboratory tests showed mild anemia and iron defi ciency (hemoglobin 11.9 g/ dL; serum iron levels 56 mcg/dL), since there was no major bleeding in the past months. Mother (who died at age 45 due to stroke), sister and daughter have similar lesions. Histology of nasal injury point to vascular dilation and deposition of hemosiderin . Bronchoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy show diffuse telangiectasias without signs of recent bleeding . As the most serious complaint of the patient was nose bleeding, he was referred to otolaryngology and is being monitored to exclude other possible foci of AVMs.

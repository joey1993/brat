A 57-year-old woman was admitted for painful lower leg ulcers. Past history included subcutaneous injection of esthetic filler material in the lower legs 20 years ago, hypothyroidism and HIV infection on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART: raltegravir, abacavir, lamivudine). Viral load was negative and CD4 cells were 600/ μl. One year before admission, bilateral torpid lower leg ulcers developed after minor trauma and progressively expanded. She was treated with diclofenac. On admission blood pressure was 190/88 mmHg (previously normal) and she had extensive necrotic ulceration and edema in both lower legs. Key lab results were serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dl (previously 1.0 mg/dl), serum albumin 3.5 mg/dl, serum cholesterol 139 mg/dl, complement factor 3 (C3) nadir 63 mg/dl, normal C4, polyclonal, Madrid, Spain Full list of author information is available at the end of the article hypergammaglobulinemia, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio 2082 mg/g, urinary protein:creatinine ratio 3557 mg/g and urinary sediment containing 20–40 red blood cells/high power field. ANCA, ANA, and anti-GBM were negative. Ulcer cultures grew Group A streptococcus pyogenes. Kidney biopsy (two cores; 9 and 11 mm long) containing 26 glomeruli, 2 of them completely sclerosed, disclosed diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis characterized by glomerular hypercellularity due to mesangial proliferation and endocapillary leukocytic infiltration . Trichrome staining revealed subepithelial fuchsinophilic deposits. Jones silver stain did not show spikes or basement membrane reduplication . Coarse mesangial and peripheral capillary loop staining for C3 was seen on immunofluorescence , without IgG, IgA or IgM deposition. Round translucent, non-birefringent microspherical bodies (30–35 μm) resembling adipocytes were identified within some capillary lumens (Figs. 1 and 2). Microspheres were also seen in a globally sclerosed glomerulus . In the tubulointerstitial compartment, intratubular red blood cell casts, acute tubular damage and patchy interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates were noted. Vessels showed arteriolar hyalinosis and moderate myointimal hyperplasia. Ultrastructural study revealed subepithelial deposits ('humps') . Treatment included local debridement, antibiotics and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Estimated glomerular filtration rate, C3 and microhematuria normalized at month 3, 5 and 12, respectively, while albuminuria progressively improved over the next 12 months . One year after the initial admission, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors had been stopped and serum creatinine was 0.9 mg/ dl, estimated glomerular filtration rate 94 ml/min/1.73 m2, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio 188 mg/g and urinary sediment contained no red blood cells/high power field.

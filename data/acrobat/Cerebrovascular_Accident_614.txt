The patient is a 59-year old man with a past medical history of smoking 76 packs/year during the last 38 years, alcoholic cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and left CEA due to symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis with amaurosis fugax; he has been under chronic antiplatelet aggregation therapy since then. During the follow-up, duplex ultrasound (DUS) of the supraaortic trunks made with a lineal probe demonstrated a typical jelly fish sign ( posterior hyperechogenic plaque, floating and mobile with the heartbeat) in the right ICA with no significant velocity changes causing a stenosis of less than 50% according to the Consensus Panel Recommendations for Classification of Internal Carotid Artery Stenosis ( and Video 1). There was no evidence of restenosis in the contralateral carotid artery. A scheduled right CEA was done with careful extirpation of the mobile plaque. Intraoperatively, the presence of the MFCP was confirmed . The histology study revealed an atheromatous plaque with rupture of the fibrous cap. Postoperatively, the patient presented with delirium tremens secondary to alcohol withdrawal and a negative brain CT scan for stroke; the episode was resolved with psychiatric medical therapy (benzodiazepines) and was discharged 9 days after surgery without any acute neurological symptom. DUS after 3 months of surgery showed no evidence of restenosis or residual flap.

A 3-year-old boy was admitted to our emergency department following mild head trauma secondary to fall from 2 m. He was alert and had a GCS score of 15. He had no motor or sensorial deficit on neurological examination. Emergency brain CT image obtained at the second hour of his fall depicted acute subdural hematoma over left frontoparietal lobe . The hematoma was in mixed density. There was a midline shift of 8.3 mm, and the width of the hematoma at the thickest portion was 11.2 mm. There was no intraparenchymal hematoma, no bone fracture, and no scalp hematoma. Surgery was postponed with a close neurological follow-up of the patient in pediatric intensive care unit, due to his well neurological status without any increased ICP findings. On the fourth hour follow-up brain CT image (2 h after the admission CT), amount of midline shift and hematoma thickness were observed to have regressed dramatically with no additional pathology . Surgery was withheld further. On the fourth day of his admission, the hematoma significantly regressed, and he was transferred to regular ward. At the second week, the hematoma resorbed totally, and he was discharged to home in well status .

An healthy non smoker 36-year-old man complaining of late spontaneous morning awakening presented to our attention because of severe headache, somnolence, blurred vision, confusion and ageusia started after a two-week period of therapy with ephedrine 0.500 g/100 mL and naphazoline 0.125 g/100 mL nasal spray for cold symptoms. Brain computed tomography performed on emergency department admission 6 h later the symptoms onset was normal. Carotids and vertebral ultrasounds were unremarkable. The neurological symptoms improved in the following hours and disappeared about 24 h later. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed 72 h later and showed a bilateral thalamic infarction ( â€“c). Intracranial angio-MRI excluded dissections, vascular malformations, aneurism, venous thrombosis, or vasculitis; however, it revealed the presence of the artery of Percheron . The screening for trombophilic factors was negative and echocardiogram was unremarkable. In particular, echocardiogram with bubble contrast excluded the possibility of the presence of an atrial-septal defect other than a patent foramen ovale. Therefore, we performed the diagnosis of stroke related to the use of ephedrine and naphazoline nasal spray.

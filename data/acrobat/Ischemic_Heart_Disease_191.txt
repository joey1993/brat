A 34-year-old woman with a background of cutaneous lupus and chronic tobacco use was transferred to our institution aft er being resuscitated from an out-of-hospital VF arrest. Her ECG showed anterior ST elevation. Emergency coronary angiography via the right radial artery (RRA) demonstrated an occluded proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) . Due to RRA spasm during exchange of the diagnostic catheters, a 5Fr JL3.5 guiding catheter was used for LAD intervention. Th e occlusion was successfully crossed with a BMW guidewire (Abbott Vascular, USA) and the lesion was pre-dilated with a 2.5x15 mm balloon with restoration of TIMI III fl ow. During unsuccessful manipulations that failed to advance a 3.5 18 mm everolimus-eluting bioresorbable scaff old (ABSORB ; Abbott Vascular, Santa Clara, CA, USA) the guiding catheter and wire positions were lost. Attempts to exchange for a 6Fr JL3.5 guiding catheter were unsuccessful due to severe RRA spasm which was not responding to high doses of intra-arterial vasodilators (verapamil and ISDN) and intravenous benzodiazepines . A new 0.014 inch BMW guidewire was advanced into the ascending aorta and a 2.0 15 mm balloon, which partially protruded from the distal end of the guide catheter, was infl ated at 4 atm proximally to the site of the radial spasm. Th is allowed smooth advancement of the 6Fr guide into the ascending aorta where the 0.014 inch guidewire was exchanged for the standard 0.035 inch guidewire and the left coronary artery

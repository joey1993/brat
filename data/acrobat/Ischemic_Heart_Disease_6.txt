A 79-year-old man underwent ascending aorta prosthetic replacement for aneurysm and coronary artery bypass grafting (with a single saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending coronary artery), by median sternotomy at our Institution. A few hours after the operation, he experienced severe hypotension and rapid onset of anemia (hemoglobin dropped from 10.7 to 7.3 gÁdL À1 ). His coagulation status was within the normal range. A chest radiograph performed promptly in the intensive care unit showed an opacity in the left upper thorax ( (a)), suspected to be bleeding from sternal wires or an iatrogenic complication at the time of central venous catheterization (puncture of the left internal jugular vein was suspected). Rapid hemodynamic deterioration required surgical re-exploration, but no surgical source of bleeding could be found. The patient received 4 units of fresh frozen plasma and 6 units of packed red blood cells, and his clinical status stabilized. On the next working day, thoracic computed tomography detected a huge extrapleural hematoma caused by rib fractures ( (a) and (b)). A chest drain was placed, with evacuation of 2500 mL of blood, partly clotted. During a 7-day stay in the intensive care unit, the patient recovered well, and computed tomography showed the effectiveness of the drainage. The patient was transferred to the ward on the 7th postoperative day, and discharged soon afterwards. After one month, a computed tomography showed good resolution of the hematoma
(d)). The patient is alive and well after 20 months of follow-up.

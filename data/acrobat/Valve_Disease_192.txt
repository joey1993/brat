A 68-year-old woman with severe mitral stenosis presented with worsening dyspnea on minimal exertion, leg swelling and orthopnea over the past 6 months. She had undergone multiple procedures in the past; including a mitral valve commissurotomy and two mitral valve replacements. She last received a stented surgical Medtronic Mosaic valve . The Mosaic valve's stent and frame are radiolucent, with opaque markers only at the stent apices, precluding their use for fluoroscopic guidance and deployment of a transcatheter heart valve. A 3D transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a severely stenotic bioprosthetic mitral valve, with minimal movement of the valve leaflets . The calculated valve area was 0.6 cm 2 , and the mean transvalvular peak gradient 14 mmHg . She was deemed high-risk for surgery and subsequently underwent transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation of an Edwards Sapien bioprosthetic valve, via the transapical approach under echocardiographic guidance alone . The patient did well, with no complications, and was discharged on postoperative day 5. This case illustrates the critical role of echocardiography in successful guidance for the delivery of current transcatheter technology, especially in cases where fluoroscopic imaging is inadequate.

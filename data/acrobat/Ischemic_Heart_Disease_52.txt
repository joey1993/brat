A 32-year-old otherwise healthy woman was presented to the emergency department with syncope. Upon questioning, she complained of chest tightness for 1 h. On physical examination her blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg, pulse rate was 55 beats/min, and respiration rate was 14 per min. Her past medical history was unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm with nonspecific T wave alterations . Her blood chemistry and blood gas analyses were within normal limits except a slightly elevated troponin level, that is, 0.011 mg/l. During her follow-up, she persistently complained of chest tightness, nausea, and sweating. The ECG revealed minor T wave flattening and inversion on precordial leads and the troponin level was slightly elevated to 0.013 mg/l. In order to rule out acute pulmonary embolism or myopericarditis, transthoracic echocardiographic examination was performed which was within normal limits. The patient was taken to the catheterization laboratory with suspicion of an ongoing ischemia. In the catheterization laboratory, respiratory depression ensued resulting in sudden cardiopulmonary arrest before introduction of femoral access. Following a 5-min-long cardiopulmonary resuscitation, cardiopulmonary circulation was secured. Catheterization was carried out on revealing completely normal coronary anatomy . During her transport to the intensive care unit, three patches of fentanyl 75 m/h were detected over the inner aspect of her medial thigh. After an 8-h follow-up period, she regained consciousness and was weaned from respiratory support. When further questioned, it became clear that she used her mother's patch, who died of breast cancer, in order to overcome her troubling knee pain.Due to the lack of efficiency, she plastered one after another and soon lost consciousness following a period of dizziness.

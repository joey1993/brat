A 2-year-old boy was transferred to our hospital from an affiliated hospital because of hemodynamic instability. He weighed 14.1 kg, and his body surface area was 0.58 cm 2. He had no previous cardiac history, but he had sustained blunt chest trauma due to a fall from playground equipment two months earlier. Physical examination revealed dilated neck veins, tachycardia (heart rate 160 beats Á min À1 ), and a paradoxical pulse. On plain chest radiography, the cardiothoracic ratio was 78% . Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large pericardial effusion associated with echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade and a moving cystic structure within the pericardial cavity , which was compressing the right atrium and right ventricle. Based on these findings and considering the possibility of a ventricular pseudoaneurysm from blunt chest trauma, emergency surgery was performed through a median full sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass on stand by on the day of urgent admission. At the pericardiotomy, a largeof non-sanguinous fluid was aspirated and the patient rapidly recovered from cardiac tamponade. A large epicardial cyst was attached to the cephalic aspect of the left atrium with a broad stalk, and adhered to the aortic root and the right pulmonary artery. The cyst, measuring 89 Â 70 Â 40 mm, was detached from the left atrium and completely excised . No cardiac anomalies were found. Histologic examination showed that the cyst wall consisted of inflamed granulation tissue with fibrin deposition and fibrosis. A culture of the pericardial effusion was negative. No evidence of malignancy was found.
The pathologic diagnosis confirmed an epicardial cyst. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient continued to do well 2 years after the operation without recurrence of the pericardial effusion or epicardial cyst.

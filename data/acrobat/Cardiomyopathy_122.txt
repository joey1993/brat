A 66-year-old man with a recent prosthetic knee infection, status postâ€“ prosthesis removal, was admitted with recurrent septic arthritis. On his seventh hospital day, as he was signing his discharge paperwork, he developed acute respiratory distress. On physical examination, he was tachycardic to 118 beats/min, relatively hypotensive from 144/78 mm Hg earlier in the day to 94/54 mm Hg, and hypoxemic, with an oxygen saturation of 94% on a 100% nonrebreather facemask. The ECG showed sinus tachycardia. An urgent contrast-enhanced chest computed tomogram (CT) demonstrated large saddle pulmonary embolism (PE) and severe right ventricular (RV) enlargement, with an RV diameterto-left ventricular (LV) diameter ratio of 1.8 . The patient was administered a bolus of intravenous unfractionated heparin followed by a continuous infusion. An urgent bedside transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe RV dilation, moderateto-severe pulmonary hypertension, and RV pressure overload as suggested by systolic deviation of the interventricular septum toward the LV . The Vascular Medicine and Cardiac Surgery services were consulted for consideration of advanced therapies. Because of concern for major bleeding associated with fibrinolytic therapy in the setting of recent major surgery, surgical pulmonary embolectomy was recommended.
The patient underwent successful urgent surgical pulmonary embolectomy . With rapid improvement in his oxygenation and hemodynamic status, he was extubated the following morning. An IVC filter was placed postoperatively. At the time of hospital discharge, the patient was transitioned from intravenous unfractionated heparin to oral rivaroxaban 20 mg daily. In vascular medicine clinic follow-up, he had returned to his baseline functional status and was free of dyspnea..

A 58-year-old woman was presented to the emergency department with severe chest pain that had begun 30 minutes ago. On admission, she was unconscious, her blood pressure was 70/40 mmHg and heart rate was 50 beats per minute (bpm). While she was being monitored, cardiac arrest occurred due to ventricular fibrillation. She was immediately cardioverted with 360 J. Electrocardiography revealed 45 bpm nodal rhythm, 2 mm ST segment elevation in inferior leads (D 2 , D 3 , aVF) and 2–3 mm ST segment depression in anterior leads (aVL, V 2-5 ) . The patient was transferred urgently to the coronary angiography (CAG) laboratory. CAG revealed normal left coronary arteries and diffuse critical stenosis of the right coronary artery (RCA) ( –b). When a 0.014 inch floppy guide wire was inserting in the RCA, prominent coronary vasospasm was revealed . After intracoronary nitroglycerine (100 µg) was injected, control images revealed non-critical coronary artery plagues in the RCA . The patient had a history of hypertension for 9 years. She had no family history of cardiovascular disease or SCD. She was on medical treatment with perindopril 5 mg daily. The patient had no history of smoking, alcohol or drug abuse. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction: 70%) with hypokinesis of inferior wall and mild mitral regurgitation. Although optimal medical therapy was given, the patient during hospitalization [diltiazem 240 mg by mouth (po) and isosorbid-5-mononitrat 60 mg po], severe episodes of angina repeated. An intracardiac defibrillator (ICD) was inserted for secondary prevention of malignant arrhythmias. The patient was discharged 10 days later. She was evaluated a month later with no complaint of chest pain. ICD records were also within normal range during controls.

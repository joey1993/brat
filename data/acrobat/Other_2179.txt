A 5-year-old Westfalian Warmblood mare was referred to the Clinic of Reproductive Medicine for dystocia in March 2012. During pregnancy, no complications were detected and parturition occurred near the calculated date of term. The obstetrical examination revealed a living foal in cranial presentation, dorso-sacral position, with bilateral carpal flexion. Correction of carpal flexion was not possible in the standing mare, resulting in the decision to perform a controlled vaginal delivery under general anaesthesia. Ten minutes after induction of anaesthesia, correction of bilateral carpal flexion was possible after elevation of the mare's hindquarters. A living filly was extracted after solely manual correction with slight traction. The foal presented with an open abdomen and extensive skin lesions . Obstetrical devices were not used for the gentle correction and extraction procedure, which makes idiopathic causes for the injuries unlikely. The newborn was euthanized due to poor prognosis and a full necropsy was performed. The mare was released from the clinic in healthy condition after treatment for retained foetal membranes.

A 71-year-old Caucasian male, with a history of aortic valve replacement in 2010 (Carpentier Edwards Perimount Magna Ease® stented bioprothesis, Ø 27 mm), was one year later referred to our academic center, with symptoms of fever (38.5°C) and malaise after two weeks of unsuccessful treatment (Amoxicillin) for suspected urinary-tract infection. A trans-thoracic echocardiographic examination was performed it revealed mild tricuspid regurgitation and an mobile echo density with clear delineated borders, adjacent to the tricuspid valve, raising the suspicion for infective endocarditis. Nine days after admission patient suddenly developed a 3rd degree atrioventricular block and signs of forward cardiac failure. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed a mobile structure near the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, grade III Tricuspid Regurgitation (TR) and a suspected abscess of the aortic annulus at the level of the Non Coronary Cusp (NCC) ( and 2). The need for external pacing with increasing systemic malperfusion (oliguria), combined with a positive response to antibiotics, signified by dropping infectious parameters led to the decision for surgical treatment at this stage.

Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has emerged as a widely used treatment option for patients with large abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). However, in the 5 years following endovascular surgery, approximately 1 in 5 patients develops endograft-related complications, such as endoleak or migration. 1â€“4 The management of these sequelae can be challenging, particularly if there is proximal endoleak, and complex endovascular solutions in the form of fenestrated cuffs are increasingly required in these situations. However, these interventions are difficult to execute due to challenges in planning, manipulation, and renal cannulation caused by the constraints of the previous endograft. We report the application of the Nellix endovascular aneurysm sealing (EVAS) system (Endologix, Irvine, CA, USA) to successfully treat a type Ia endoleak. An 87-year-old man presented to our unit with an asymptomatic 7.6-cm infrarenal AAA  and a 4.5-cm right internal iliac artery aneurysm. He underwent embolization of the right internal iliac artery followed by EVAR  using an aortouni-iliac device (Zenith ZAUI-36-161-ZT; William A. Cook Australia, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia) with a 13-mm limb extension to the right external iliac artery (EIA) due to a tortuous left common iliac artery (CIA). The left CIA was occluded using an Amplatzer Vascular Plug (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA), 5 and a right-to-left femorofemoral crossover bypass was performed with an unsupported 8-mm Dacron graft. Routine duplex ultrasonography surveillance was unremarkable at 3, 6, and 12 months with a stable sac size; however, 24 months after the index EVAR, an asymptomatic type Ia endoleak was detected. Following ultrasound assessment,

The patient was a 20-year and 4-month-old woman with no apparent relevant family history who had developed severe and persistent heart failure two years previously and was subsequently referred to our hospital for the management of refractory cardiac dysfunction. At 2 months of age, the patient was found to have bilateral contractures of the fingers (camptodactyly), which was followed up at her local orthopedic hospital along with progressive scoliosis. During her high school years, she sat out from gym classes due to lumbago; however, no cardiovascular abnormalities had been detected on school physical examinations. At 18 years and 4 months of age, she suffered from progressive dyspnea, and an cardiac echocardiogram obtained on the first hospital admission to a local general hospital revealed left ventricular (LV) dilatation and severely decreased LV contractions, with a normal structure and function of the valves. The LV diastolic diameter (LVDd) and ejection fraction (EF) were 58 mm and 18%, respectively. Her blood pressure was low, and she was diagnosed with DCM. Treatment with the beta-blocker carvedilol was titrated to a dose of 10 mg daily, which resulted in temporal and partial improvements in her subjective symptoms and echocardiographic findings (LVDd: 57 mm, EF: 25%).

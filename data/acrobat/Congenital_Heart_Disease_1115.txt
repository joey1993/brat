A 23-year-old woman presented with sudden painless visual loss in the left eye of 100 min. She had been diagnosed with PTA at the age of 1 month. In medical history, she had no ophthalmic problem and had maintained good visual acuity. There was no history of vascular occlusion affecting other organs. On examination visual acuity of 20/20 in the right and light-perception was noted in the left eye with a left relative afferent pupillary defect. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable with normal intraocular pressures. Fundoscopic examination revealed retinal ischemic whitening, constriction of the arteriole and venule with segmentation and typical " cherry-red spot " suggesting CRAO . The patient was treated with ocular massage * Correspondence: zhoudan0928@sohu.com; 289736582@qq.com and anterior chamber paracentesis. She was commenced on 150 mg of aspirin and also received hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Her visual acuity returned to hand motion in the temporal direction. Fluorescein angiography of the right eye carried out on the second day was normal, whereas the left eye showed a delay in arterial filling and large areas of nonperfusion. An echocardiogram was performed (Figs. 2 and 3) and revealed a single and dilated truncal artery overriding both ventricles, a subtruncal ventricular septal defect (VSD) and absence of pulmonary valve and arteries. A diagnosis of persistent truncus arteriosus was established. The annulus size of common truncus was 41 mm. A single atrium, normal function of the left ventricle, and a hypertrophied right ventricle with severe tricuspid regurgitation were shown. Ultrasonography of the carotid arteries was unremarkable. Furtherevaluation for an underlying cause was unrevealing, with a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, blood count, renal function and ionogram, liver tests, glycosylated hemoglobin and hemostasis. A head computed tomography scan at this time demonstrated no abnormalities.

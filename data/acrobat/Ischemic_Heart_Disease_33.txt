A 44-year-old man presented with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography demonstrated complete stenosis of the first obtuse marginal artery. This could not be revascularized percutaneously, and he was managed conservatively. Over the next 7 days, he developed pulmonary edema requiring continuous positive airway pressure respiratory support. Echocardiography revealed a rupture of the left ventricular (LV) lateral wall with bidirectional flow into a contained 7-cm posterolateral pseudoaneurysm compressing the left atrium . Emergency surgery was indicated. After median sternotomy, dense intrapericardial adhesions were encountered. Left femoral arterial and right atrial cannulation was performed, and cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted to enable further mobilization of the heart and ascending aorta. The circulation was cooled to 30 C, the aorta was clamped, and antegrade cardioplegia was administered. The large pseudoaneurysm sac was opened, revealing a 3-cm defect in the lateral wall of the LV. The defect was closed with a bovine pericardial patch, using interrupted horizontal mattress Teflon-pledgeted 3/0 polypropylene sutures . The pseudoaneurysm sac was closed over the repair with interrupted horizontal mattress Teflon-pledgeted 3/0 polypropylene sutures and reinforced with a continuous 3/0 polypropylene running suture. The blocked obtuse marginal artery could not be identified due to the adhesions and inflammation, and was therefore not grafted. The circulationwas rewarmed, and cardiopulmonary bypass was discontinued with the aid of inotropic and intraaortic balloon support. The patient was weaned from intraaortic balloon support and inotropics one week later, and he made a slow but unremarkable recovery. Postoperative echocardiography did not show any residual defects.

A 10-year-old patient, the second son of unrelated parents , had no facial dysmorphism or lower limb defects. His mental and speech development was normal, similar to his brother. His mother had bilateral dysplasia of the thenar eminence and had undergone intracardiac surgery for ASDat age 7 years and pacemaker implantation due to complete atrioventricular block at age 38 years. Deformity of the patient's left arm was observed during gestation. He was born via a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery with a birth weight of 3,150 g. He presented with typical manifestations of HOS: asymmetrical bilateral radial ray abnormalities (partial absence of the left radius and hypoplastic carpals and hypoplastic right radius and carpals) , secundum ASD, and muscular ventricular septal defect. The ASD was corrected at age 5 years, just after surgery for sick sinus syndrome, which needed temporary pacing. An electrocardiogram revealed atrioventricular dissociation , which converted to normal sinus rhythm with mild exercise.

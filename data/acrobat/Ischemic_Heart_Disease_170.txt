This patient developed AKI in the setting of cardiac surgery. Cardiac surgery–associated AKI (CSA-AKI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality; 5% to 30% of cardiac surgery patients experience some degree of AKI, depending on the patient's risk factors before surgery (1). The Cleveland Clinic risk score for the postoperative need of dialysis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery identified women, surgery type (valve replacement with or without CABG), preoperative cardiovascular status (such as congestive heart failure or use of an intra-aortic balloon pump), and preoperative renal function to be significant predictors of CSA-AKI (2). The Cleveland Clinic score has been validated in multiple cohorts and shown to have fairly high discrimination in tested populations (3,4). Other risk factors specific for CSA-AKI include advanced age, diabetes mellitus, morbid obesity (defined as a body mass index.40 kg/m 2 ), and intravenous contrast exposure (5–7) . Studies on the association between the risk of postoperative AKI and the timing of contrast exposure before cardiac surgery have shown mixed results. Some studies have shown that the risk of AKI after CABG is inversely related to the time between cardiac angiography and CABG, including one recent meta-analysis that found that a time interval of 1 day or less between angiography and on-pump cardiac surgery was associated with increased risk of AKI (8,9). Others have reported no increased risk of AKI based on timing of contrast (10). In our case, the patient's angiogram preceded surgery by more than 5 days. According to the Cleveland Clinic risk score, our patient's estimated risk for dialysis after cardiac surgery was 1.8% given her risk factors: woman, CKD, redo surgery, and morbid obesity (2). No validated scoring system exists for predicting the risk of less severe AKI.

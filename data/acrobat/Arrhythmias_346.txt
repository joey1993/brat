Case 1 A 50-year-old woman was admitted to department of ear–nose–throat (ENT) due to swelling in her neck for a month. Her physical examination was been normal except submandibular lymphadenopathy. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) was applied for her submandibular lymphadenopathy (LAP). Pathological examination showed necrotising granulomatous reaction. Then, she was referred to our department for granulomatous LAP. She had no systemic disease nor symptoms except swelling in the neck. Physical examination was normal except Abstract Cardiac sarcoidosis is an infiltrative, granulomatous inflammatory disease of the myocardium. Generally, it can be difficult to diagnose cardiac sarcoidosis clinically because of the non-specific nature of its clinical manifestations. This property can be based on the presence of any clinical evidence of sarcoidosis in the other organs. We present two cases of cardiac sarcoidosis so as to demonstrate its different clinical manifestations. The first patient displayed no cardiac symptoms; the electrocardiogram showed an incidental right bundle branch block. Her cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) revealed late-phase opaque material enhancement involving the inferior and inferoseptal segment of the left ventricle. The second patient was severely symptomatic in terms of cardiac involvement, and a transthoracic echocardiogram revealed global hypokinesia and septal brightness; his ejection fraction decreased to 45 %. These cases highlighted the challenges encountered in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac sarcoidosis. CMRI should

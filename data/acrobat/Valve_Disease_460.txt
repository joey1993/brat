We operated on 3 patients with mitral valve regurgitation. All patients were over 75 years old, and computed tomography revealed extensive, near-circumferential MAC (see Supplementary material, ). Patient characteristics are summarized in . Although Patients 2 and 3 had severe aortic stenosis that may have affected their congestive heart failure, mitral valve repair was required because the mitral valve exhibited degenerative disease with moderate mitral regurgitation associated with a high possibility of devastating postoperative heart failure. Patient 2 had a long history of haemodialysis, and Patient 3 required intra-aortic balloon pump support for haemodynamic instability before surgery. The aetiology of mitral valve regurgitation in each case as assessed by echocardiography is given in . Supplementary material, shows mitral valve prolapse as detected by transoesophageal echocardiography in Patient 1. The severity of mitral valve regurgitation was scored by the echocardiography findings . The left ventricular function was decreased in Patient 3 with an ejection fraction of 45% on intra-aortic balloon pump support. Each operative schema is summarized in
). The mitral regurgitation, mean pressure gradient and mitral annular diameter did not increase (four-chamber view/two-chamber view: Patient 1, 27.8/26.9 mm; Patient 2, 34.8/36.2 mm; Patient 3, 29.6/31.2 mm) during the follow-up period (>2 years postoperatively), and all patients were in New York Heart Association class I or II.

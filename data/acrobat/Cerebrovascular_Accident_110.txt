A 4-year-old boy accidentally fell down a flight of stairs and crashed through a glass door with penetrating zone II neck trauma with laceration of the right carotid artery and internal jugular vein. Upon arrival of the medical emergency team, the child had massive neck hemorrhage, hypotension with poor skin perfusion, and scored 5 on the pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The patient was admitted to another institution where he presented marked mucocutaneous pallor, cold skin, absence of peripheral pulses, periods of right tonic conjugate eye deviation, and decerebration posture. He was immediately taken to the operative room but carotid artery reconstruction was not possible and ligation was performed. Post-operatively, the patient showed anisocoria with a larger right pupil and immediate computed tomography (CT) scan showed an extensive right fronto-temporo-parieto-insular cortico-subcortical hypodensity and coexisting hypodense lesions in the right basal ganglia. The child was transferred to our Pediatric ICU for neurosurgical support.

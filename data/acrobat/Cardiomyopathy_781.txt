A previously healthy 43-year-old man was sent to our emergency department, with a high fever, chills, throat pain, myalgia, and poor appetite for about four days. His initial blood temperature, pulse rate, and blood pressure were 40 Â°C, 112 beats/min, and 120/71 mmHg, respectively. Chest radiography revealed mild infiltrates in the left lung field . No leukocytosis (white blood count 7380/ul; normal range: 4140 ~ 10520/ul) but predominant neutrophils (neutrophil: 85.8 %, normal range: 41.8 ~ 70.8 %), thrombocytopenia (platelets 92000/ul, normal range 160000 ~ 370000/ul), and high C-reactive protein 77.30 mg/L(normal range <5 mg/L), aspartate aminotransferase 384 u/L(normal range:10 ~ 42 u/L), alanine aminotransferase 291 u/L(normal range: 10 ~ 40 u/L), and troponin I 0.06 ng/ml levels (normal range < 0.04 ng/ml). A rapid influenza test using a specimen from a nasopharyngeal swab was negative. In addition, urine Streptococcus Ag, Legionellae serotype I and serum Mycoplasma IgM were all negative. Rapidly, his general condition worsened with chest tightness, cold sweating, and dyspnea. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia and the followed cardiac enzyme tests revealed a creatine kinase (CK) level of 1593 IU/L(normal range 26 ~ 174 IU/L), a CK-MB level of 45.2 IU/L(normal range: 0.4 ~ 6.3 IU/L) and a troponin I level up to 71.01 ng/ml (normal range < 0.04 ng/ml). The B-type natriuretic peptide level was 104 pg/ml (BNP < 100 pg/ml). Subsequent chest radiography revealed diffuse bilateral opacities ( and c). He was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for emergency intubation and mechanical ventilator support (48 h later after admission) due to acute respiratory failure. He was treated with oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice daily for 5 days from day 4 even though the rapid influenza test was negative. Finally, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from endotracheal aspirates showed positive results for influenza B based on the report of Centers for Disease Control, Taiwan. In the ICU, because of his high serum cardiac enzyme, myocardia infarction was suspected and coronary angiography was arranged soon but it revealed no prominent stenosis. Cardiac echography showed normal chamber size, normal LV segmental wall motion without significant valvular defect and the ejection fraction of left ventricle was about 60 %. The result is not compatible with heart failure. Besides, the chest x ray and chest CT both showed diffuse lung opacities. Taken together the above clinical Initial chest radiography demonstrated mild pulmonary infiltration over the left lung on day 1 (a). A portable chest X-ray revealed prominent bilateral infiltrates at 48 h later after admission to our hospital (b), progressed to worse picture on day 4 (c) and recovery to near-normal x ray on day 22 (d) evidence, influenza B related acute respiratory distress syndrome was diagnosed ( , b). Initially, empiric antibiotic with levofloxacin was administered but imipenem/cilastatin 500 mg q6h was then administered because of his rapidly worsening ARDS after being transferred to the ICU. His conditions gradually improved and the endotracheal tube was successfully removed on day 22 , after which he returned to an ordinary ward. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed abnormal enhancement of left ventricular wall, especially at anteriorinferior wall of the left ventricle , consistent with acute myocarditis. Fortunately, he was discharged without prominent complications on day 35. The time course of troponin I and CRP were demonstrated in .

A 79-year-old Japanese man visited our hospital with an 8 week history of low-grade fever and high-serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. He also had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, although his familial history was unremarkable. His laboratory data revealed a white blood cell count of 8090/ml and CRP levels of 13.2 mg/dl. No antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies or syphilis was detected. Contrastenhanced computed tomography (CECT) revealed aortic wall thickening from the ascending section to the common iliac artery , which indicated large vessel vasculitis (LVV). Two weeks later, he developed right hemiparesis and dysarthria and was transferred to our emergency room. He did not complain of headache, blurred vision, jaw claudication or myalgia during the course. On admission, different systolic blood pressures were observed in each arm (right: 135 mmHg, left: 160 mmHg), and bruit was not audible over the carotid artery. He had no induration or tenderness of his temporal arteries. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed high-signal areas at the left corona radiata . We diagnosed the patient with ischemic stroke complicated with LVV, and began oral prednisone at 0.5 mg/kg/d. Although the patient's serum CRP levels rapidly decreased, he developed ischemic colitis with diffuse colonic ulcers 4 days later, which was confirmed by colonoscopy. Given the insufficient control of the vasculitis, we escalated the prednisone dose to 1 mg/kg/d. After prednisone escalation, no haematochezia or neurological symptoms recurred. After rehabilitation and tapering the prednisone for 6 weeks, the patient was discharged while receiving 40 mg/day of prednisone. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing revealed HLA-A2, A24, B39, B52, DR2 (DR15) and DR6 (DR14).

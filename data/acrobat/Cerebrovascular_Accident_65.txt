A 56-year-old male with a history of untreated hypertension and active smoking had been found unconscious in the street. The initial Glasgow Coma Scale was 4. Computed tomography (CT) showed subarachnoid hemorrhage in both left and right Sylvian fissures, in the ambient cistern and within the fourth ventricle (Fischer IV). CT angiography of the brain revealed a 6 9 5 mm aneurysm within the cisternal segment of the right AChoA. Conventional angiography was performed within 48 h of the hemorrhage. After a thorough inspection of the final portion of the right internal carotid artery, we noticed a duplication of the right AChoA. In fact, the aneurysm was located at the origin of the superior branch of the AChoA (Figs. 1, 2). After microcatheterization of the aneurysm, coil embolization was used to obtain complete occlusion . The patient came out of the coma a few days later. He displayed temporospatial disorientation and agitation. A neurological examination revealed dyspraxia of the left arm, left homonymous hemianopia and memory disturbances but no sensory or motor impairments. He also presented with Terson syndrome. Neither ischemic lesions nor hydrocephalus were seen on a post-embolization CT scan. Four weeks later, the patient was admitted to a rehabilitation unit.

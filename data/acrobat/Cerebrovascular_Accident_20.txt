characterized through immunohistochemical staining. Thereby, the lymphoid cells were characterized as positive for CD20, Bcl2, and predominantly Ki67, without any expression of cyclin D1 and CD10. Based on these findings, the working diagnosis of GCA was changed to a recurrent, perivascular marginal zone lymphoma, as the same expression pattern of biomarkers was found for the right-sided, retrobulbar NHL that was diagnosed 2 years prior to the current disease. Curative-intended involved field radiation was started after the completion of staging examinations.

History and Examination A 5-year-old boy presented with no significant medical history, and a diagnosis of AVM was made. His mother and older brother both had HHT; his mother had undergone surgery for the resection of a cerebral AVM, 35 and his brother had suffered from tetraplegia caused by an AVM of the cervical spinal cord. 31 Based on his family history, he had also undergone screening MRI at 5 months of age, which revealed no lesions of the brain or spinal cordHereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant systemic disorder characterized by the enlargement of capillaries, recurrent nosebleeds, and multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Although cerebral AVMs are traditionally considered to be congenital lesions, some reports have described de novo AVMs, which suggests that the authors believed them to be dynamic conditions. In this article, the authors describe the case of a 5-year-old boy with HHT in whom a de novo cerebral AVM was detected after a negative MRI result at 5 months. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a de novo AVM in a patient with HHT. In patients with a family history of HHT, de novo AVMs are possible, even when no lesions are detected at the first screening. Therefore, regular screenings need to be performed, and the family should be informed that AVMs could still develop despite normal ). He had no medical problems except recurrent nosebleeds. At 5 years of age, he suffered from a transient thunderclap headache. Repeat MRI at this presentation revealed an abnormal signal void in the right parietal lobe , and cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed a nidus with the predominant arterial supply from the right middle cerebral artery . A diagnosis of HHT was made on the basis of family history, recurrent nosebleeds, and evidence of a cerebral AVM; no genetic diagnosis was made .

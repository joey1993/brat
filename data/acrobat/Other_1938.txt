A 69-year-old woman was admitted to the respiratory ward in Beijing Jishuitan Hospital in the beginning of April, 2013 after experiencing chest pain and a fever. More than 10 days before admission, the patient felt chest tightness without obvious inducement and had shortness of breath and position-related left chest pain. She also had weakness in the lower extremities and difficulty in sitting up; her chest pain was relieved after activity. One week prior to admission she experienced a fever, which began in the afternoon without an obvious cause and persisted until admission. The highest temperature was 37.7, accompanied by chills. The fever was relieved without treatment. She had no cough or sputum. Six days before admission, she came to the outpatient department.

End of March, 2013, using local anesthesia, thoracoscopy was performed on the right side of the patient's chest. The endoscopic findings  showed multiple yellow nodules on the pleura. These nodules were lobulated and had abundant blood supply. A biopsy was performed at the nodules, and the pleural effusion was aspirated. After centrifugation of the pleural effusion, the cells were smeared ( , 6) and malignant cells were observed at a large volume and increased nuclear cytoplasm ratio. A histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen  showed crowded cells, and the nuclear/cytoplasm ratio was particularly high. The cytoplasm of the cells had nearly disappeared, and different-sized nuclei were strongly stained (Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E staining). Those characteristics were consistent with the characteristics of malignant cells. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD3 (scattered cells), CD31 (positive for vessels), CD43 (a small amount of positive staining), CK (spotty positive staining), Ki-67 (15% positive), LCA (scattered cells), CD38 (weakly positive), MC (spotty positive staining), D2-40 (spotty positive staining), CD138, MUM1, and vimentin (weakly positive). Immunohistochemical staining was negative for CD20, CD56, CD99, CK20,CgA, EMA, S-100, SY, TTF-1, CD79a, calretinin, and Syn. According to the results of the immunohistochemical analyses, plasma cell tumor was suspected. A bone scan (in the beginning of ) showed an uneven distribution of elevated radioactivity at the skull and increased punctate distribution of radioactivity at the left rib numbers 5 and 6. The scan also showed uneven distribution of increased radioactivity at T11-L1 vertebrae, including sparse areas with radioactivity, and increased radioactivity at the right tuberositas femoris, left femur, and left tibia . Lumbar and pelvic CT (in the beginning of May, 2013) showed there were destructions at multiple lumbar and pelvic bones, and there were small, patchy, low-density shadows at the bilateral femurs ( , 10). The flow cytometry results of the pleural effusion (in the beginning of ) showed that 84.69% of the nucleated cells expressed CD38, CD56, CD138, and C λ, however, they did not express CD27, CD28, CD117, CD20, CD 19, C kappa, cIgM, HLA-DR, κ, or λ. The cells in the pleural effusion were malignant monoclonal plasma cells. The results of a bone marrow biopsy showed hyperplasia of the nucleated cells. The granulocyte/erythroid ratio was 3.24. Granulocytes accounted for 60% and erythroid cells accounted for 18.5% of the total cell number. Each developmental stage of the hematopoietic cells was present. Granulocytes and monocytes were observed. Plasma cells accounted for 6.5% and all of them were immature. A peripheral blood smear was normal. A bone marrow biopsy was performed at the posterior iliac spine, with an acceptable length of the specimen. In the marrow, there were a large number of monotonous cells with medium to large cell volume. Additionally, the cytoplasm was pink (H&E staining) without significant particles, and there was a large, round, or irregularly-shaped small, red nucleolus. No wheelshaped karyon was observed. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for MUM1, CD138 reticulocytes, and negative for MPO, CD43, CD99, TdT, CD34, κ, λ, CD20, CD3, and CD117. The malignant cells were bulky and immature. The patient's diagnosis was non-secretory MM, DSS stage IIIA; ISS stage I. The second patient with MPE was a 57-year-old man who was admitted in April 2011 for treatment. He had right shoulder pain and a 10-cm painless lump at the back of the right shoulder for 2 months. An X-ray showed a right clavicle fracture. Shoulder CT showed destruction of the right clavicle and the right ninth rib. Chest CT showed osteolytic destruction at the right side of the distal clavicle and the right ninth rib, a soft tissue mass, and destruction at multiple ribs. A whole body isotope bone scan showed abnormalities of the right distal clavicle and the right posterior ribs (6 and 9) associated with a pathological fracture of the right clavicle. Blood leukocytes were 5.08×10 9 /L, hemoglobin was 138 g/L and the platelet count was 159×10 9 /L. The serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase levels were normal. The serum level of albumin was 41 g/L, creatinine was 84 μmol/L, and calcium was 2.28 mmol/L. The lipid, enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase, potassium, sodium, and chloride levels were normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 27 mm/h. The serum level of β2microglobulin was 4.2 mg/L, IgA was 11.7 g/L, and κ light chain was 10.7 g/L; moreover, IgG, IgM, and λ light chains were reduced. Monoclonal IgA κ light chain was observed at the β-area using serum immunofixation electrophoresis. Κ light chain was observed using urinary immunofixation electrophoresis. Κ light chain in the 24-hour urine was 257.4 mg. Plasma cells in the bone marrow smears accounted for 4.5% of the total cells. Flow cytometry of the bone marrow showed that 3.81% of the nucleated cells were abnormal clonal plasma cells. A biopsy of the tumor at the right shoulder showed plasma cell tumor [positive for CD38, CD138, Ki-67 (10%), and MUM1, and negative for . The diagnosis was MM IgA-κ, DSS stage IIIA; ISS stage II. After chemotherapy, the disease showed partial remission, however, progression occurred 1.5 years later. Fatigue, wheezing, and other symptoms emerged. A medium amount of right pleural effusion appeared, and pericardial effusion and ascites were found by CT. The pleural effusion was yellow exudate, and lacked physical and chemical characteristics. Myeloma cells in the pleural effusion were found by the smear. The flow cytometry results showed that 41.98% of the nucleated cells in the pleural effusion expressed CD38, CD138, C κ, κ, CD28, CD45, and partially CD56. There was no expression of CD117, C λ, CD27, CD19, λ, or CD20. MPE was confirmed. Flow cytometry confirmed that the myeloma cells were also present in the pericardial effusion and ascites of the patient. Myeloma cells in the ascites were found by the smear, however, those in the pericardial effusion were not found by the smear.

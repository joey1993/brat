The patient was a 63-year-old physician with a mitochondrial disorder (multiple lipomatosis) and moderately severe statin myopathy. He had severe nocturnal leg cramps that abated during drug holidays from statins and recurred reproducibly on reinitiation of statins; they were only partly relieved with CoQ10 150 mg daily. He had proximal muscle weakness in the hip girdle, and creatine kinase levels were repeatedly elevated to 4 to 5 times the upper normal limit for the laboratory, despite reducing his dose of rosuvastatin to 5 mg daily in combination with ezetimibe. Because of these difficulties, he stopped statin therapy despite a coronary calcium score of 300 and a family history of premature cardiovascular death. At that time, his carotid total plaque area (a strong predictor of cardiovascular risk 127â€“129 ) was only 20 mm 2 , so he felt somewhat reassured about the safety of stopping statin, while continuing ezetimibe.

A previously healthy 17-year-old African American male presented to the emergency department with acute onset of chest pain and shortness of breath that awoke him from sleep. He denied fevers, cough, palpitations, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash and was maintaining adequate oral intake with normal urine output. Two weeks prior to presentation, he fell and scraped his right leg on asphalt while playing basketball. He subsequently developed purulent abscesses overlying his right shin. He was evaluated for these wounds the day prior to presentation and was started on cephalexin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Physical examination revealed vital signs appropriate for age and normal oxygen saturation on room air. He generally appeared uncomfortable, though he exhibited no respiratory distress, had clear lung fields bilaterally, and had a regular cardiovascular examination without murmurs. He also had multiple small (1-cm diameter) purulent abscesses with surrounding erythema overlying his anterior right leg. In the emergency department, he received a dose of ketorolac and hydromorphone for pain control. Initial workup was notable for elevated inflammatory markers with a normal electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, complete metabolic panel, and complete blood count. Further workup with chest computed tomography to evaluate for pulmonary embolism demonstrated multiple nodular lesions in the periphery of the bilateral lung fields concerning for septic pulmonary embolism (SPE) or bronchopneumonia (see ). Empiric therapy with intravenous (IV) vancomycin and clindamycin was started after wound and blood cultures were collected. He was placed on a morphine patient-controlled analgesia infusion for pain relief and was admitted for further evaluation and management.

Forty-four patients treated for BNS between 1995 and 2014 were identified at 17 French centers. At the time of BNS diagnosis, the median age was 63 years (range, 47-84 years) and 35 patients (80%) were male. In 16 cases (36%), BNS was the first manifestation of WM; five of these patients had a previous diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and the median time between the diagnosis of this gammopathy and that of BNS was 48 months (range, 9 to 108 months). For the 28 (64%) patients previously diagnosed with WM, the median time interval between the diagnosis of WM and that of BNS was 8.9 years (range, 9 months to 24.7 years). For 20 (71%) of the 28 patients previously diagnosed with WM, BNS occurred independently of a systemic progression of WM. Thirteen patients (33%, 13/39 patients with available data) were reported to have a diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy before the onset of BNS, and antiglycolipid antibodies were positive in six (46%) of them [5 patients with anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (antiMAG) antibodies and 1 patient with anti-ganglioside (anti-GM1) antibodies]. The patients' characteristics are summarized in .

A 47-year old male presented to the emergency, with severe abdominal pain in the epigastrium. Ultrasound of the abdomen was normal. Contrastenhanced CT of the abdomen (Figures 1 and 2) revealed a communicating vessel between branches of the portal vein and middle hepatic vein suggestive of portohepatic venous shunt, which showed aneurysmal dilatation. This aneurysm measured approximately 18 x 12 x 12 mm in size. No other abnormality was seen on CT. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed features of gastritis, for which he was treated with antihistaminics and antacids. Pain was completely relieved after 2 weeks of treatment. No immediate intervention was done for the shunt as it was an incidental finding and not causing any symptoms. Laboratory investigations, including complete haemogram and liver function tests, were normal. No evidence of hyperammonemia or galactosemia was seen. Patient is on regular follow up, to look for any increase in the size of the aneurysm or any evidence of hepatic encephalopathy.

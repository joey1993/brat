A 67-year-old woman presented to the neurosurgical department after development of sudden headache and nausea. On admission, her blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg with a history of arterial hypertension. A cranial computed tomographic (CT) scan revealed SAH with no signs of hydrocephalus (Hunt and Hess grade III, Fisher III). The digital subtraction angiography revealed a posterior communicating artery aneurysm (6×3 mm), which was successfully treated by coiling on the day of admission. On day 1 after coiling, the patient was alert, without further motor deficit. Her mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was between 80 and 90 mm Hg . On day 4, the patient developed a hemiparesis on the left side. A CT scan showed no rebleeding or hydrocephalus. The CT angiography showed slight multifocal CVS. Considering vasospasm-associated neurological decline, the MAP was maintained ≈110 mm Hg. The patient recovered slowly from her hemiparesis during the next 6 days of induced hypertension. On day 10, the patient again started deteriorating neurologically. She was confused, and after focal seizure, she was intubated. CT perfusion and CT angiography scans did not show any significant perfusion deficits but slight residual CVS. At this time, our patient was spontaneously hypertensive. Because of the suspected residual CVS, we did not actively treat her hypertension. A follow-upthe diagnosis of PRES as it shows that the lesions are widely reversible, as reversibility is 1 hallmark of PRES.

A 51-year-old male with a history of smoking underwent transthoracic and transoesophagial echocardiography after a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and right retinal artery occlusion. Echocardiography documented a mass of 26 mm × 24 mm attached to the mitral valve , medium degree mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, and thrombosis of the aortic arch and descending aorta.

Complete blood count and biochemical tests, including electrolytes, kidney, heart and liver function tests were within normal limits, and repeated cultures of blood and urine were all negative. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) confirmed the presence of a calcified lesion on the mitral valve of unclear extent ( ,C); no signs of thrombosis of the aorta were found. Based on recurring signs of TIA, including visual disturbance, speech problems and leftside dysaesthesia, the decision was made to excise the lesion surgically. For pre-surgical evaluation of localization, extend and nature of the mass, the patient was referred for 3 T CMR imaging (Magnetom Trio, Siemens AG, Healthcare Sector, Erlangen, Germany). Differential diagnoses of the mass included caseous calcification of the valvular annulus, valvular calcified thrombus, calcified tumor (calcified myxoma or papillary fibroelastoma of mitral valve), or intra-cardiac cystic lesion. A comprehensive, ECG-gated CMR imaging protocol was carried out in breath-hold and included prototype T1 and T2 mapping sequences.

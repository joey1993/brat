The index case was a 13-year-old male, diagnosed with HCM after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in 2009, when he was jogging during physical education class. He was resuscitated, requiring 2 shocks with an automated external defibrillator, and was implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shortly after the event. Over the 4 following years, he has received at least 12 discrete appropriate, ventricular fibrillation-terminating ICD shocks. The first one occurred about 5 months after placement of the ICD, and the last one was as recent as February of 2013, despite numerous changes in medications. During the most recent episode, he received multiple shocks in the setting of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and needed 7 ICD discharges to return to normal rhythm. All events occurred in the setting of some level of aerobic activity.

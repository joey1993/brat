A 31-year old man with progressively worsening functional status was admitted with Class IV heart failure. He had experienced blunt trauma to the chest in a motorcycle accident 16 years before. At that time, a cardiac problem had been overlooked in a local clinic. Recently, evident right-sided heart failure and atrial flutter with mild ascites and pleural effusion were observed in this patient.

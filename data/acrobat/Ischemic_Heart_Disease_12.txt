the hospital on postoperative day 14 ( (b)). The hematoma was slightly increased in size on a coronary computed tomography angiogram and on a coronary artery angiogram 3 months after the procedure ( (c) and (d)). Coronary angiography was repeated 10 months after the intervention and it showed an enlarging pseudoaneurysm ( (e) and (f)). Surgical treatment was undertaken. The right epiploic gastric artery was dissected, and offpump coronary artery bypassing was carried out on the right coronary artery distal to the pseudoaneurysm. The pseudoaneurysm was dissected, and the afferent/efferent arteries were closed with a mattress suture. The pseudoaneurysm was opened, and the position of the Taxus stent was confirmed. The stent was observed throughout the aneurysm, and the possibility of stent edge injury was excluded. Because the stent could not be removed due to adhesions, the pseudoaneurysm was closed directly with a mattress suture . The postoperative course was uneventful, and coronary computed tomography angiography showed extirpation of the aneurysm and distal perfusion of the right coronary artery via the right epiploic gastric artery.

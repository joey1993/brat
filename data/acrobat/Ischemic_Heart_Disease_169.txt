A 41-year-old female was treated for a stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) by implantation of a 3.5 mm 18 mm stent (Cypher Select , Cordis J & J, Miami, USA) . The woman was admitted 15 months later due to ACS and ST-depression in the anterior ECG leads. Cardiac biomarkers were elevated. CAG showed no (re)stenosis or stent thrombosis but slight peristent contrast staining was identifi ed in the proximal LAD . Frequency domain OCT (C7 system, St. Jude Medical, Memphis, USA) showed peri-stent evaginations, as described by Raber et al. and detailed by ), and uncovered stent struts and multiple luminal thrombi . The stent was well expanded compared to reference segments. The patient was stabilized with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor infusion. No interventional treatment was performed. Dual antiplatelet therapy was reinstated indefi nitely.158 S. E.
shock within a few hours of admission. Prior to the fatal incidence, the patient was treated with aspirin. On autopsy the coronary arteries were gently removed, immediately fi xed in formalin, radiographed, dehydrated, and embedded in plastic. Detailed pathological preparation and evaluation was performed as previously reported (8). Although this patient had a total of 10 stents implanted over the 10 years from the fi rst stent implant in 2000, it was the Cypher â„¢ stents implanted in 2006 that showed malapposition, infl ammation and fi brin-rich thrombi . The area around the Cypher stent showed extensive chronic infl ammation consisting of lymphocytes, macrophages, giant cells, and eosinophils . Histological examination of the area of myocardium supplied by the LAD showed multiple small areas of fi brosis consistent with healed myocardial infarcts. There were also sections with abundant polymorphonuclear leukocytes typical for an acute MI in the same area.

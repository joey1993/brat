An 11-year-old Tunisian boy was referred to our department for the exploration of syncope. There was no family history of myxoma. On admission, his pulse rate was 100 beats/minute and blood pressure was 100/60mmHg. He had no signs of congestive cardiac failure. On physical examination, a grade 4/6 systolic ejection murmur was heard at the left upper sternal border. His chest radiography was normal. His electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm of 110 beats/minute and ST segment depression in leads V1-V4 with right ventricular hypertrophy and right axis deviation. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large mobile 19×19mm mass attached to RVOT. The pulmonary valve seemed to be spared. The tumor was causing an obstruction of the RVOT . His RV-to-pulmonary artery pressure gradient was 90mmHg. His echocardiography showed right atrium (RA) and RV dilatation, mild tricuspid regurgitation with right ventricular systolic pressure at 105mmHg. Abdominal ultrasound and venous Doppler of both his lower limbs were normal. He was anaesthetized, perioperative cardiac arrest occurred, emergency sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was established through aortic and bicaval cannulation. His RA was opened. Operative findings revealed a gelatinous 20×20mm mass, originating 1cm below the pulmonary valve and attached to the RVOT on its septal surface . The mass was completely removed. The diagnosis of myxoma was confirmed by histology. The postoperative period was uneventful and he was discharged after 7 postoperative days. Postoperative echocardiography documented an unobstructed RVOT .

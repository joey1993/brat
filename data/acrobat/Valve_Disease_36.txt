A 75-year-old lady (height 162 cm, weight 67 kg) taking vitamin K antagonists for multiple venous thromboses and in New York Heart Association class II was hospitalized after presenting with acute chest pain and syncope on exercise. Multiples lipothymia had been reported at the age of 35 years, also occurring on exercise, but not screened since. On admission, clinical examination and an electrocardiogram were normal except for the presence of a mild aortic systolic murmur. Cardiac ultrasonography showed normal left ventricular function, a calcified aortic valve with moderate stenosis (effective orifice area 1.1 cm 2 ) with a mean transvalvular gradient of 38 mm Hg and a maximal peak flow of 3.7 m s Ã€1. Coronary angiography revealed a dominant right coronary artery and ALMCA from the right sinus of Valsalva with an abnormal intramural trajectory, the typical so-called ''killer artery'', confirmed by coronary computed tomography . At surgery, the ostium of the left coronary artery was found beside the right coronary ostium, with an anterior-to-posterior intramural trajectory between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk, associated with moderate aortic stenosis. After removing the aortic valve, we repositioned the left coronary artery using the unroofing technique, 1 thus creating a new ostium into the appropriate aortic sinus. For aortic valve replacement, we used a 23-mm CarpentierEdwards Perimount supraannular aortic bioprosthesis. The postoperative curse was uneventful. On follow-upat 14 months, computed tomography confirmed perfect patency of the new ostium of the left coronary artery inserted in the left aortic sinus of Valsalva .

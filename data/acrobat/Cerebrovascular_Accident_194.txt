Using computer simulation, we attempted to analyse the case of a 65-year-old man who underwent a previous replacement of both CAs and coronary artery bypass grafting and who presented with ICPP and pseudoaneurysm 3 years after the initial operation.
The written informed consent for participation in the study was obtained from participant. Due to a delicate circumstances and presence of a massive infection involving prosthetic tube graft, a decision was made to extensively debride all synthetic material on the right side of the neck and to reconstruct the right CA with autologous graft. We decided to perform a carotid–carotid cross-over bypass using the great saphenous vein. After removal of the synthetic graft on the right side, left common CA was dissected bellow the insertion of the prosthesis. Inflow end-to-side anastomosis between vein conduit and left common CA was performed . Vein graft was routed retroesophageally as an interposition graft. Outflow anastomosis was performed between the vein conduit and right carotid bifurcation in end-to-end fashion, while the right common CA stump has been previously overseen. Computed tomography measurement of the carotid– carotid bypass was used for making a computer model .

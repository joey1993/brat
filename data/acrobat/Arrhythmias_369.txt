A 64-year old female was referred to our service for symptomatic aortic insufficiency. Echocardiography revealed quadricuspid aortic valve with three normally located leaflets and one smaller leaflet (the supranumerary leaflet) . After informed consent was obtained, she underwent aortic valve replacement. After sternotomy, standard cardiopulmonary bypass with right atrial cannulation was used. Cardiac arrest was achieved by retrograde cardioplegia. The outside of the aortic root was dissected from the right ventricle to allow suture placement. The aortic valve was exposed and inspected by standard transverse aortotomy . The valve was quadricuspid and three normally located leaflets and one supranumerary leaflet located between the non-coronary and right coronary leaflets were present. The valve was excised and 2–0 braided, non-everting sutures with pledgets were placed on the left coronary, right coronary and non-coronary annuls in the usual fashion. On the valvar hinge that corresponded to the supranumerary leaflet, three pledgeted sutures were passed from the outside to the inside of the sinus of Valsalva. Care was taken not to go underneath the level of the valvar hinge (Figs. 2A–C). The sutures were passed through the cuff of the bioprosthetic valve and placed on the supra-annular position. The aorta was closed and the aortic clamp was removed. Sinus rhythm was restored spontaneously, and cardiopulmonary bypass was discontinued in the usual fashion. Transoesophageal echocardiography showed the normally functioning bioprosthetic valve without an evidence of perivalvular leak. Postoperative course was uneventful with no documented arrhythmia.

A 30-year-old right-handed woman experienced acute onset left hemiparesis and visuospatial problems during her first experience with scuba diving. Before this event, she worked as an illustrator of three-dimensional computer graphics and was generally healthy, except that she had experienced two episodes of transient left arm numbness and weakness while under acute emotional stress: the first event occurred when she was 6 years old, and the other occurred when she was 12 years old. The left hemiparesis developed within 30 minutes after the scuba diving, with some fluctuation for the following 3 days. Meanwhile, she got lost in the Mass Rapid Transit station, lost her ability to touch type, and became unable to find the toolbox in the computer graphics program she used for her work. On admission to our Stroke Center on the third day after onset, the patient manifested left centralâ€“type facial palsy, left hemiparesis, left hypesthesia, and left-sided unilateral spatial neglect. Interestingly, mirror clock drawing ( , panel A) in addition to the unilateral spatial neglect ( , panel B) was noted, whereas , panels C and D). Brain MRI scans showed recent infarcts in the right frontoparietal subcortical regions ( , panels A and B) and small cortical areas ( , panel C). MR angiography and further conventional angiography revealed bilateral steno-occlusive middle cerebral arteries with formation of multiple tiny collateral vessels, indicating moyamoya disease. Her clock drawing became normalized at 3 weeks after stroke onset, along with improvements in the left hemiparesis and spatial neglect.

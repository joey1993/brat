A 55-year-old woman with EDS (type 2, classical) presented in April 2013 with severe skin laxity of her face and neck, requesting rejuvenation surgery to address her premature facial and cervical ageing in order to restore her selfesteem. She had experienced extensive postoperative bleeding and bruising previously from surgical procedures undertaken on her wrist and knee joints, and had profound awareness of her condition at her initial consultation with the senior author. At subsequent assessments, spanning over four months, it was mutually agreed that standard face and neck rejuvenation procedures were high risk in her case, but the procedure could be modified with limited tissue excision and conservative tissue handling to titrate the surgical outcomes to her realistic expectations. The patient fully consented, and the risks of significant scaring postoperatively due to her condition were clearly outlined to her. The procedure was performed in August 2013. Her preoperative photographs demonstrate excess skin in the jowls, the upper part of the neck, and the lower part of the neck, which were the patient's main concern .

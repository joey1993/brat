A 50-year-old man presented with sustained wide complex tachycardia and was treated with cardioversion. He gave a history of 2 such episodes within the past 7 years, requiring cardioversion each time. Ten years previously, he had undergone surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot. Review of operative notes indicated that the procedure included patch closure of the ventricular septal defect, right ventricular outflow tract resection, repair with a transannular patch, and pulmonary valve replacement with a porcine valve.

A 78-year-old man with a past medical history of NVAF and hypertension was admitted to our Stroke Unit due to the acute onset of right-sided hemiparesis and aphasia. A brain CT scan showed slight hypodensity in the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory and neurological examination revealed an NIHSS score of 21. The patient's family reported that he was on treatment with rivaroxaban 15 mg and had taken a rivaroxaban tablet 26 h earlier; there was no concomitant use of P-glycoprotein inhibitors. Serum laboratory tests demonstrated normal kidney function and normal standard coagulation markers (PT, aPTT, INR). At 3.5 h of symptoms onset, the patient underwent thrombolytic therapy with intravenous tPA, following the standard protocol. A CT scan was performed at 24 h showing complete MCA infarction with mild haemorrhagic transformation (H1 according to the ECASS definition). Ultrasound examination did not reveal any vascular occlusion or stenosis; NIHSS score at 24 h was unchanged. At discharge, the NIHSS score was 18. A past medical history of atrial fibrillation, the presence of complete MCA infarction with open arteries, and no evidence at ultrasound of atherosclerotic vessels were suggestive of a cardioembolic stroke. Rivaroxaban was substituted with dabigatran 150 mg 9 2 at discharge.

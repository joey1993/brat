The report was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. A 45-year-old male with distant anterior wall myocardial infarction was referred for a third attempt at catheter ablation of VT. Prior attempts had failed, primarily due to haemodynamic intolerance of VT. He was being maintained on high-dose oral amiodarone, with frequent recurrences chronicled by his implantable cardioverterdefibrillator.

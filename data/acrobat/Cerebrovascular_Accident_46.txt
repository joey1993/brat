A 39-year-old woman was admitted in March 2009 with polyarthritis for 2 years and recent onset of oral ulcers and alopecia. Investigations revealed Coomb's positive hemolytic anemia (hemoglobin 7.9 g%), active urinary sediments [red cells 20–30/ high power field (HPF) and white blood cells 15–20/HPF], proteinuria of 700 mg/day, antinuclear antibody (ANA) positivity (4þ coarse speckled at 1:80 dilution), extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) profile showing antibodies to Sm and RNP, low serum complements (C3 27.9 mg%, normal 60–120 mg%; C4 <5.4 mg%, normal 15–25 mg%), elevated anti-dsDNA antibodies by ELISA (>200 IU/ml, normal <30 IU/ml), and normal serum creatinine (0.7 mg%). Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was 26.1 s (control 29.8 s). IgM anticardiolipin antibody (ACLA) (6 MPL U/l) and IgG ACLA (13.8 GPL U/l) were negative. Renal biopsy showed active Class IIIA lupus nephritis. She was induced with six monthly pulses (750 mg/m 2 ) of intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCY) and oral prednisolone in tapering doses, followed by oral azathioprine for maintenance. With this, she attained complete renal remission. In April 2013, she presented with lupus flare following drug default for 2 months (active urinary) were normal and antidsDNA antibodies were undetectable. Computed tomography of the head revealed intracerebral hemorrhage in the right temporoparietal region. In view of intracerebral hemorrhage in the absence of thrombocytopenia, magnetic resonance angiography of the cerebral circulation was done suspecting an aneurysmal bleed. It showed hematoma in the right fronto-parietal region with extension into the right sylvian fissure and minimal subdural bleed , aneurysm at the trifurcation of the right middle cerebral artery  and thrombosis of right transverse and sigmoid sinus ( (a,b)). The latter prompted for a reevaluation of pro-thrombotic state. There was no family history of ischemic stroke, venous sinus thrombosis or peripheral venous thrombosis at a younger age. Repeat values of IgM ACLA (<3 MPL U/l), IgG ACLA (<3 GPL U/l) and antib2GPI (<5 IU) were negative. APTT was normal (23 s; control 26.7 s), hence lupus anticoagulant was not done. Protein S functional activity was low (47%; range 65–140%); protein C functional assay showed normal activity (121%; range 70–130%). Anticoagulation was not started immediately in view of the recent intracerebral bleed. As she was being stabilized and awaiting a definitive surgical procedure for the aneurysm, she collapsed and died.

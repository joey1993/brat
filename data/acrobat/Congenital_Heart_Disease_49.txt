A 69-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department with a 10-h history of vomiting fresh blood. He also had a history of half-month black stools. Admission labs revealed a Hb of 7.4 g/dL (normal range 12–16 g/dL), a Hct of 23 % (normal range 40–54 %). An emergency gastroesophageal endoscopy was performed and revealed the presence of blood in the stomach and the duodenal but no bleeding source. The next day the patient had a further drop in his Hb. A second gastroesophageal endoscopy was performed and the site of bleeding could not be identified. Selective celiac trunk arteriogram  and selective superior mesenteric arteriogram  demonstrate the left gastric artery (LGA), right gastric artery (RGA) and superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries were clear and normal. The celiac trunk or superior mesenteric angiography had no available finding. A left inferior phrenic angiogram revealed active bleeding from a small gastric artery originating from the left IPA . A right inferior phrenic angiogram revealed active bleeding from the duodenal artery originating from the right IPA

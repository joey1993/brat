History A 73-year-old man with a history of multiple prior lumbar spinal surgeries presented with confusion after a syncopal ground-level fall. Head CT demonstrated bilateral thin subdural hematomas without significant mass effect , which remained stable on a follow-up CT scan. His condition rapidly improved to a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15, and he was discharged in good condition after a negative syncope workup and 24 hours of observation. Three days later, he presented again after a sudden collapse.

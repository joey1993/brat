A 16-year-old female patient with Ebstein anomaly was admitted to the hospital for 2 episodes of hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT; ). Two months earlier, she had undergone surgical tricuspid valve replacement with a biological prosthetic valve and cavopulmonary anastomosis . Both VT episodes were treated with external direct current cardioversion, and the patient was then referred to our center to attempt VT ablation. Unfortunately, the fact that the right ventricle (RV) was papyraceous and the free ventricular wall was thin would have exposed the patient to a high risk of catheter perforation. Because transvenous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation had the same risk of cardiac perforation, and access to the right cardiac chambers had been made unfeasible by cavopulmonary anastomosis, subcutaneous (S)-ICD implantation was considered. In assessing the patient's adequacy for S-ICD implantation, the morphology of the QRS was screened to avoid T wave oversensing . Because of the bizarre morphology of the QRS attributable to severe dilatation of the RV, QRS screening was performed with the left arm electrode placed to the right side of the xiphoid process . Under local anesthesia and conscious sedation, the catheter was inserted subcutaneously from the pocket in the left midaxillary region to the right side of the xiphoid process. The tip was then advanced up to the manubrio-sternal junction, 1 cm to the right of the midsternal line. At the end of the procedure, a defibrillation test was performed: clinical VT was induced, correctly sensed, and treated after 12.5 seconds with a 65 J shock (conventional polarity configuration). On 2-month follow-up examination, the patient did not have any complications, and no significant events were recorded.

He was given intravenous fluids, broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics and had a CXR, which was unremarkable. A bedside ultrasound revealed an aortic aneurysm of 5.1 cm in diameter. He then had a second intravenous cannula inserted, blood was cross-matched and an urgent CT of the abdomen and surgical review were arranged. The CT showed a 7.5 cm infrarenal AAA with active contrast extravasation. The iliac vessels were not involved, and the thoracic aorta was normal with no evidence of dissection. He was taken to the operating theatre and had an emergency endovascular aneurysm repair. He made a good recovery and was discharged home after 12 days.

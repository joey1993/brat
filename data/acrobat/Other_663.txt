A 49-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer metastatic to bone suffered a pathological fracture to the left femur while hospitalized . Eighteen hours after the fracture, he developed hypoxemia and hypotension followed by confusion and a petechial rash in the left axilla. Chest X-ray obtained after intubation demonstrated new diffuse bilateral patchy infiltrates . Urgent transthoracic echocardiogram showed right ventricular dilation and free wall hypokinesis with preserved contractility of the right ventricular apex (McConnell's Sign; , Movie I in the online-only Data Supplement). Based on the clinical presentation and supportive imaging, the patient was diagnosed with fat embolism syndrome. He was transferred to the intensive care unit for further management.
Aggressive resuscitation with intravenous crystalloid and vasopressors was initiated in the intensive care unit. Mechanical ventilation was continued for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's condition stabilized, and he was extubated two days later. His hypoxemia, altered mental status, hypotension, and petechiae resolved completely.

A 53-year-old woman was admitted to our service after the sudden onset of severe headaches, nuchal rigidity, and confusion 3 hours earlier. A cranial computed tomography revealed a basal subarachnoid hemorrhage and intraventricular blood with mild hydrocephalus. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a large saccular aneurysm originating from the anterior communicating artery. The patient was transferred to the ICU, anesthesia was induced, and external ventricular drainage placed. Then, the patient was forwarded to the angiography operating room to obtain a DSA . An interventional radiologist and a vascular neurosurgeon reviewed the DSA images and decided to obliterate the aneurysm by endovascular coiling, which was done on the same day without complications . During the entire angiography and coiling procedure, no VS was encountered at any time, so the patient underwent baseline MEP recording, as described above, immediately after returning to the ICU.
lists baseline MEP thresholds. On day 9 after aSAH, TCD flow velocities for the right-sided anterior and medial cerebral arteries showed a considerable increase of 55 cm/s over values on the day before. MEP thresholds were obtained, as shown in , and the patient was forwarded to DSA, which revealed a significant spasm of the right-sided M1  compared with the initial DSA  and no spasm of any other artery. Chemical spasmolysis was performed immediately by using intra-arterial administration of nimodipine, which led to a complete normalization of the diameter and blood flow in the M1.

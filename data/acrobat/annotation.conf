# Our purpose is to guarantee that every case report can be described as a continuous time series. Here is a list of rules to help you:
	# 1. Event vs Entity: all events are temporal comparable and entities are not. Only activity, sign symptom, disease disorder, procedure, medication, and lab should be considered when annotating temporal relations, because it doesn’t make sense to compare demographics, anatomical structure, etc. with each other or a time expression;
	# 2. Annotate adjacent entities.  For example, for the following sentences, “A happens. B happens. C happens.” We only need to annotate (A before B) and (B before C), even if there is no explicit temporal relation between A and B. We assume the time progresses continuously across sentences. Do NOT annotate (A before C) since it is unnecessary;
	# 3. A time expression should be connected with only one entity, because ideally all the events are placed in a continuous time series, there will be duplicates if a time expression is connected to two entities;
	# 4. The direction of arrows for temporal relations should be forward, i.e. from a previous entity to a later one. Note it doesn’t apply to the relation of modifier;
	# 5. Modifiers are only used for compensating the lacking of relations among entities. For example, "the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 71 per hour.", the "71 per hour" is a frequency test result, so we build a modifier between it and "(AHI)". In this example, the full name and abbreviation have overlaping relation since they are both events, and we need a temporal relation to connect them, for which "overlap" is the best here. Then we do not need any modifiers to denote the relation;
	# 6. We add a type called "other". If you choose "other", please indicate the exact type of that entity/event in "Notes" section;
	# 7. Duration v.s. Time/Date: for example, "for two months" is a duration, but "two months later" is a date. Although "two months" is a duration, we choose to annotate "two months later" as a date and annotate the duration (i.e. "two months") as a quantitative concept.

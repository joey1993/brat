A 45-year-old man came for cardiac screening evaluation because of an abnormal ECG. He had undergone occupational health screening 8 years previously and had been noted to have T-wave inversion from V2 to V4. He had not pursued any further investigations. He was asymptomatic, with no history of syncope. Examination results were within normal limits. A 12-lead ECG again showed anterior T-wave inversion, with no associated Q waves . A transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild asymmetrical interventricular septum thickening, measuring 14 mm in diastole (Movie I in the online-only Data Supplement). A treadmill exercise test showed horizontal ST depression in the absence of symptoms of chest pain. Because of the ECG and echocardiogram findings, a cardiac MRI was requested. This showed extensive crypt formation in the interventricular septum, with septal thickening up to 12 mm ( , Movies II and III in the online-only Data Supplement). Note was also made of an anomalous origin of the left circumflex coronary artery, and this was again seen on coronary angiography, although no obstructive plaque was detected. A diagnosis of multiple left ventricular clefts in the setting of early hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was made, and genetic studies for structural cardiomyopathies have been requested.

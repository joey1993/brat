A 2-year-old girl diagnosed with NS was referred to our dermatology department for evaluation of multiple skin nodules on her trunk. The patient had been clinically diagnosed with NS based on congenital heart failure and several congenital anomalies, such as webbed neck and epicanthal folds. Cutaneous nodules were detected at birth, and their number and size had increased gradually with age. On examination, the patient exhibited multiple skin-coloured nodules on her lower abdomen . Some café-au-lait spot-like pigmented macules were also detected on her abdomen and back . Histological analysis of the nodules revealed hyperplasia of fibroblast-like spindle cells in the lower dermis . No granular cell tumour-like cells, which have a granular appearance in the cytoplasm, were observed. To characterize the nature of the tumour cells in more detail, immunohistochemical analysis was performed using anti-smooth muscle actin, S-100, desmin, β-catenin, CD68, factor XIIIa, and CD34 antibodies. However, no positive signals were detected in the tumours with the above antibodies (data not shown), suggesting that the tumour cells are mesenchymal in origin and composed mainly of fibroblasts. To investigate whether activation of the RAS-MAPK signalling pathway was involved in the tumour formation, further immunohistochemical analysis of the tumour was performed.

A 53-year-old male patient visited our clinic with intermittent chest discomfort during exercise. He had no significant past medical or family history. Physical examination revealed no abnormal findings. The resting ECG showed normal sinus rhythm. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in the parasternal short-axis view at the level of the aortic valve showed thickened and systolic doming pulmonary valve leaflets with mild pulmonary regurgitation and a dilated main pulmonary artery . The diameters of the aorta and main pulmonary artery were 33 mm and 41 mm, respectively. Continuous wave Doppler at the pulmonary valve showed mild pulmonary stenosis, peak flow velocity across the pulmonary valve of 2.0 m/s, and a peak pressure gradient of 16 mmHg. With angulation of the transducer superiorly from the left parasternal window, a short-axis view of the pulmonary valve was obtained, showing a quadricuspid valve with a deficit of central coaptation . The patient was further evaluated by ECG-gated multidetector row CT. CT angiography revealed 40-50% stenosis in the right coronary artery and a quadricuspid pulmonary valve with valvular thickening and a mildly dilated main pulmonary artery. The pulmonary valve showed 3 equal cusps and 1 smaller cusp on axial view . As the patient showed no limitations on treadmill testing, he was put on regular follow up.

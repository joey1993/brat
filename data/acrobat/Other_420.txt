A 57-year-old man presented with dyspnea on exertion and leg swelling for four months. He had undergone surgical repair of ruptured right SVA by direct closure at age of 19, and remained asymptomatic after the operation. On physical examination, a grade 3/6 continuous murmur was heard at his right lower sternal border, with increasing intensity while he was leaning forward. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial flutter with 2:1 atrioventricular conduction (ventricular rate around 100 beats per minute) and complete right bundle branch block. Chest X ray revealed enlargement of right atrium and ventricle, but no pulmonary congestion. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed bicuspid aortic valve and a large cystic structure protruding from right sinus of Valsalva to the right atrium. The wall of the cystic structure was relatively thick and hyperechoic, which was distinct from the congenital form of SVA ( , b). Color duplex showed a continuous shunt from the aorta to the right atrium through a small defect at the posterior aspect of the aneurysm ( , d, e and Additional file 1: Movie 1). Gradual bulging of the previous patch sutured at the SVA 38 years ago with recurrent rupture was impressed. Multidetector computed tomography also demonstrated a large SVA with a defect connecting to a dilated right atrium . Surgical exploration from both right atrial side and aortic side confirmed the communication between SVA and the right atrium . The defect was located at a weak point of suture between the previous patch and the sinus of Valsalva. Double patch method was performed with bovine pericardium patches. From the aortic side a patch was sutured from the aortic annulus to the inferior rim of the right coronary artery; and from the right atrial side the redundant sac of the SVA was resected and the defect was repaired with anotherpatch. The patient was discharged uneventfully two weeks after surgery.

A 16-year-old boy visited our hospital because of bloody diarrhea and anal pain which had persisted for 2 months and was diagnosed with CD. Treatment with oral mesalazine atcentesis showed no bacterial growth, but the drug lymphocyte stimulation tests (DLSTs) for mesalazine were positive. According to these findings, the patient was diagnosed with mesalazine-induced acute pleuropericarditis, and the administration of mesalazine was discontinued at day 33, which resulted in an immediate improvement of the clinical symptoms, the normalization of the CRP level after a week , and the disappearance of left pleural effusion . The patient was treated with infliximab instead of mesalazine, and remission of CD was achieved with no recurrence of the pleuropericarditis.

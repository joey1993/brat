A 57-year-old man was urgently admitted to a neurosurgical hospital with an SAH in May 2010 . Surgery was performed to clip the ruptured internal carotid aneurysm, remove hematomas, and to perform coil embolization of the basilar artery. Three months after the neurosurgical procedure, the patient was admitted to our hospital because of left pleural fluid effusion, and he underwent an open pleural biopsy. A histological examination of the biopsy specimen revealed the features of biphasic mesothelioma, which was predominantly sarcomatoid in nature. Contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a brain tumor near the SAH-induced hematoma in the right occipital lobe . Thus, it was necessary to definitively diagnose whether it was a metastatic brain tumor. In October 2010, the patient underwent surgery to remove the brain tumor because of its rapidly increasing size and its potential to cause epilepsy. A complete resection was achieved. A subsequent immunohistopathological examination of the resected brain tumor revealed that it had metastasized from an MPM As the patient could benefit from chemotherapy, he received two cycles of systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin (75 mg/ m 2 ) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m 2 ). After undergoing chemotherapy, the patient experienced a chemotherapy-induced loss of appetite, and consequently, impaired liver function. Due to these effects, his general medical condition worsened and his ECOG Scale of Performance Status score decreased to 4, indicating that he was completely disabled, not ambulatory, and incapable of self-care. Although he displayed no recurrence, the patient did not respond to treatment, and died two months after surgery.

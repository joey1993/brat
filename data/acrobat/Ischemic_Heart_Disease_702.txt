From June 2010 until June 2011, 22 consecutive patients receiving an eSVS® (Kips Bay Medical, Inc., Minneapolis, USA) meshed saphenous vein coronary bypass graft (SVG) wereprospectivelyenrolledanddataanalyzedpost-hoc.Graft patency as the main endpoint was evaluated by cCTA one year after surgery. Potential risk factors for graft occlusion were statistically analyzed as secondary endpoints. 3 patients were ruled out due to non-device related in-hospital cardiac (n = 1) or post-discharge non-cardiac death prior to the scheduled 1-year follow-up. The data collection (Tables 1, 2 and 3) consisted of patients' characteristics (including NYHA class), coronary artery disease and left ventricular function (LVEF), surgery (including perfusion-type, native coronary run-off, technique of proximal anastomosis, graft harvest technique / site and quality, mesh sizes, intra-operative transit time flow-measurement, device related complications) and postoperative follow-up (including MACCE). Clinical and cCTA follow-up was provided one year after surgery. A total of 22 patients received an eSVS® mesh from 06/ 2010 to 06/2011 (with subsequent one-year cCTA in 19 patients). The eSVS® mesh implantation was successful in all patients. Patients' baseline characteristics are shown in .

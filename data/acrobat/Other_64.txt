We report the case of a red, infi ltrated, solitary plaque measuring 9 cm in the major axis, which had appeared two months before consultation on the shoulder of a 47-year-old female patient . On palpation, the lesion was tender, fi xed on the superficial and deep tissues. No pain or itching was reported. Histological examination showed a slightly acanthotic epidermis and large vascular lobules in the full-thickness dermis . Each lobule was composed of aggregates of endothelial cells concentrically whorled along a preexisting vascular plexus. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for CD31 and CD34, and negativity for smooth muscle actin . A diagnosis of " Acquired Tufted Angioma " was made. Due to the benignity of this lesion and the frequent spontaneous regression of TA, no treatment was suggested.TAs develop before the age of 5 years, and 25% of tumors appear before the age of 1 year. Less than 10% of TAs occur after the age of 50 years, and its onset in people older than 60-80 years is rare. 7 Cases seem to appear sporadically, although a family with several members affected has been reported. 8 TA is generally described as a dull red, brownred, or purple cutaneous patch or plaque with angiomatous appearance. The patch or plaque slowly enlarges for 5 months to 10 years, after which no further growth occurs. The diameter of the patches generally ranges from less than 1 cm to several centimeters. On palpation, TA often has a rubbery consistency and may be painful. Some lesions may resemble connective tissue abnormalities.

A 23-year-old man with palpitations was noted to have a WPW pattern suggestive of a right-sided accessory pathway . An echocardiogram demonstrated a structurally normal heart with a slightly decreased ejection fraction, and a cardiac event monitor was applied. On day 13, while watching a movie with his family, the patient experienced an abrupt onset of chest pain and palpitations, and he became very anxious. When emergency medical services arrived, he was unresponsive and unable to be revived despite multiple defibrillation attempts. Review of his cardiac event monitor demonstrated preexcited sinus rhythm followed by premature ventricular complexes that triggered orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia. This degenerated into rapidly conducting preexcited atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation persisted for >3 minutes and then deteriorated into ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death .

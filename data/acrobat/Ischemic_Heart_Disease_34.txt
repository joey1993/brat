A 33-year-old woman presented to our emergency department with sudden-onset chest pain. Her past history was remarkable for antiepileptic drug therapy between the ages of 3 to 13 years. On cardiac examination, a 2/6 apical systolic murmur was auscultated. Her pulse rate was 72 beatsÁmin À1 , blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 22 breathsÁmin À1. An electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, consistent with acute inferior wall myocardial infarction. Cardiac enzymes including troponin were elevated. A telecardiogram showed a 2.5cm calcified structure superimposed on the heart shadow. The patient underwent coronary angiography with an initial diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. The LCx had total occlusion of its proximal segment and a 30 Â 20-mm structure with a calcified wall adjacent to the occluded segment, which was moving synchronously with the heart . CT was obtained for a definitive diagnosis. It showed patent left anterior descending and right coronary arteries. There was amm fusiform thrombosed aneurysm with a calcified wall in the proximal part of the LCx . No surgical intervention was scheduled because the aneurysm was totally thrombosed. The patient was started on an oral antiplatelet agent and discharged for outpatient follow-up.

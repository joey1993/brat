A 66-year-old male was admitted to our facility with a chief complaint of low-grade fever (body temperature: 37.8 °C) and progressive exertional dyspnea for past 3 days. The patient underwent regular hemodialysis for 10 years as treatment for diabetic nephropathy. He had a history of valvular heart disease with severe mitral regurgitation with congestive heart failure and underwent mitral valve repair 2 years prior to consultation. Regular outpatient department follow-up with oral ticlopidine at a dose of 100 mg daily was recorded. Neither recent medical history with surgical procedure nor recent trauma history was reported. The patient went to our emergency department and his chest plain film revealed unilateral (right side) fat-shaped pleural effusion . Chest CT imaging disclosed a right side EPH . Hemoglobin and hematocrit values were 7.5 g/dL and 29 %, respectively. Moreover, his white cell count and platelet count were 7,620/mm 3 and 173,000/mm 3 , respectively. Prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times were determined to be 11 s and 31 s, respectively. His INR level was 1.1 s (0.8 s–1.2 s). Serum values for urea nitrogen and creatinine were 42 mg/dL and 5.7 mg/dL, respectively. A chest tube was placed in the right pleural area and 500 mL of hemorrhagic fluid was drained. Thoracoscopic surgery with evacuation of clots was performed on the first day after admission. Severe adhesion between visceral pleural and parietal pleura of the right lower lobe and old blood clots retained in the costophrenic angle and major fissure were noted. No active bleedings were observed. However, a progressive bilateral EPH developed after the operation. Poor general condition with severe coagulopathy subsequently developed. Profound hypotension was also noted. A high-dose inotropic agent was administered and massive blood transfusion was performed; however, his condition continued to deteriorate. Finally, the patient expired on the fifth day after admission.

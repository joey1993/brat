A woman in her 50s with no cardiac risk factors was assessed in an outpatient cardiology clinic for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atypical chest pain. Her initial ECG is shown in . Question: Is the ST-segment elevation compatible with acute myocardial infarction (MI)? The tracing in shows ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads with reciprocal changes suggestive of an inferior STsegment elevation MI (STEMI). A repeated ECG 30 minutes later demonstrated resolution of ST-segment abnormalities . Given the transient ST-segment elevation, the patient was referred to our institution for urgent coronary angiography. This demonstrated normal coronary arteries, and the patient was admitted with a presumptive diagnosis of vasospasm. While some cardiologists believed the changes were real, others were convinced that they were due to artifact. Subsequent ECGs and troponin I level (<0.04 ng/ mL) were normal. The patient was discharged home after 48 hours of observation.
A woman in her 70s was assessed in the same outpatient clinic for a cardiac murmur. Her initial ECG demonstrated ST-segment elevation , which resolved after 10 minutes . She was transferred to our facility for coronary angiography. Given the pattern of ECG findings, it was concluded that ECG abnormalities were artifactual. Therefore, she did not undergo invasive testing. The patient was observed for 8 hours with normal serial ECG results, negative biomarkers, and normal wall motion on echocardiogram. Suspecting equipment malfunction, we arranged for the ECG machine to be examined by our biomedical engineering department. Careful examination of the device identified an intermittent, unexpectedly high impedance in the left leg (LL) lead cable. This confirmed that cable microfracture was the cause of the ECG abnormalities shown in Figures 1A and C.

We report on a 45-year-old man with cardiogenic shock and 6-mm ST elevation in V1â€“V6 leads on ECG who was admitted to our hospital. Since there is no cardiac catheterization laboratory in the hospital, the patient underwent fibrinolytic therapy with alteplase. He died 1 h after admission. His medical history revealed that, 7 years earlier, he had experienced posterior myocardial infarction, and was successfully treated with a bare metal stent into the right coronary artery. The post-discharge observation had been unremarkable with no evidence of ischaemia or infection. The patient had a prescription for aspirin and clopidogrel for 12 months, but he did not take any medication and was not hospitalized thereafter. Autopsy revealed complete closure of the left main coronary artery and a surprise additional finding, namely a myocardial abscess. The stented portion of the right coronary artery was enveloped by an abscess and purulent material completely occluded the stent, which was floating in pus .

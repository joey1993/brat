An 11-month-old male patient without any significant previous medical history was found to have an abnormal increase in cranial circumference during routine surveillance, associated with plateauing of the growth curves. On clinical examination, there were no neurological abnormalities and no signs of cardiovascular impairment. A brain MRI  revealed an abnormal dilatation of the vein of Galen, measured at 2.1 cm in diameter. Angiographic sequences demonstrated arteriovenous shunting between this dilatation and branches of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA), compatible with a diagnosis of vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation (VGAM). Moderate secondary tri-ventricular hydrocephalus was also observed. Pretreatment angiographic evaluation  confirmed a diagnosis of mural type VGAM. Direct arterial-venous shunts were observed between three separate arterial branches, and the dilated median prosencephalic vein that drains into the straight sinus: the posterior medial choroidal artery originating from the distal basilar trunk, the posterior lateral choroidal artery from the left P2 segment, as well as a smaller right posteromedial choroidal artery from the right P1 segment. A stenosis of approximately 60 % was seen in the initial part of the straight sinus. The venous drainage of the two cerebral hemispheres was redirected towards the superficial venous system.

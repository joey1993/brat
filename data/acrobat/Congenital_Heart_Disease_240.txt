History A 74-year-old woman started experiencing low-back pain following a rear-end car collision. She was in the driver's seat at the time of the collision and was wearing a seatbelt. Her primary complaint was low-back pain. Upon admission, she showed tenderness at the lower back and could not walk because of low-back pain. Her neurological examination was normal without any motor or sensory deficits in the lower extremities. She was initially treated conservatively. After 3 weeks of bed rest, she was mobilized with a lumbar orthosis. However, the severe low-back pain persisted, and union of the L-4 vertebral body was not achieved 3 months after trauma; hence, she was referred to our hospital for surgery.

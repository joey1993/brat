In April 2006, a 61-year-old male without coronary risks was referred to our cardiology department because of severe chest oppression 7 days after vincristine–adriamycin–dexamethasone chemotherapy (, which persisted for several minutes and rapidly disappeared with sublingual administration of nitroglycerin. Cardiac troponin T was negative. Echocardiography was normal, and iodine-123-beta-methyl iodophenyl– pentadecanoic acid imaging demonstrated a decreased uptake in the middle inferior wall compared to thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging. Coronary arteriogram revealed no significant organic stenoses; however, acetylcholine provocation test revealed diffuse subtotal occlusion in proximal left anterior descending and circumflex arteries with ST-T changes and chest oppression . We therefore diagnosed with multivessel coronary vasospasm. The diagnostic criteria for Crow-Fukase/polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes syndrome, sometimes reported with ischemic heart disease, were not fulfilled. He reattempted with the fifth cycle of VAD. On days 5–10, he developed similar symptoms more frequently and earlier than previous cycles. Severe attacks accompanied by transient ST-segment elevation in various leads concentrated on days 6–8. During the sixth cycle of VAD, chest symptoms reappeared extensively on days 6–9 even afteradministration of benidipine, atorvastatin, ethyl icosapentate and aspirin.

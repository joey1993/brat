Our patient was diagnosed with a congenital bicuspid aortic valve and underwent valve replacement with a first-generation BSV ( plano-convex), size 21 (serial# 21 AB2136) on 27 February 1973 for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. She has been adequately anticoagulated with warfarin to keep her INR between 2.5 and 3.5. During the follow-up of 42 years, she underwent vaginal hysterectomy and partial left mastectomy followed by radiotherapy for breast carcinoma in 2002. She complained of palpitations in 2013 and a 24-h Holter monitor revealed insignificant premature ventricular contractions. The patient is now 77 years old, and able to walk 2â€“3 miles most days of the week, which classifies her as functional class 1. Her clinical examination reveals an audible prosthetic sound, soft ejection systolic murmur and a faint diastolic murmur over the aortic area.
The patient's echocardiograms have been scheduled for appropriate follow-up . The most recent study done in April 2015 revealed a well-seated, normally functioning prosthetic aortic valve with a mean pressure gradient of 18 mmHg , valve area of 1.1 cm 2 and trivial aortic insufficiency ( and F).
and C shows the images from the echo done in 2013, and no haemodynamic changes were observed over the years. The left atrium and the left ventricle remain normal in size and the ascending aorta is mildly dilated up to 4.2 cm (normal for BSA of 1.6 2 is 3.8 cm) ( and E). Left ventricular systolic function was normal with an estimated ejection fraction of 65% (Video 1), and haemoglobin was 13.1 g/dl without evidence of haemolysis.

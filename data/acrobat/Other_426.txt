A 47-year-old man presented with acute pulmonary edema with severe progressive dyspnea and orthopnea. He had a 10 pack-year history of cigarette smoking, but no other medical or familial conditions. Chest radiograph showed a small right-sided pleural effusion. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia without any conduction abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CRMI) showed a tumor (4 Ã— 5 cm) occupying the side wall of the right atrium budding into the lumen . Through a median sternotomy, a radical excision of the neoplasm was performed; the atrial wall was reconstructed using a bovine pericardial patch. The post-operative course was unremarkable and the anatomical pathology analysis revealed fusiform cells with considerable nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic activity. The immunohistochemical study was positive to vimentin, desmin, actin, and HHF-35, and negative for PS-100, cytokeratin, and hormone receptors. The final diagnosis was cardiac leiomyosarcoma. Adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin (60 mg/m 2 day 1) and ifosfamide (3 g/m 2 day 1 and 2) were realized and MRI after the four cycles did not show any sign of local or distant relapse. Seven years after the first operation, local recurrence with a metastatic paravertebral soft tissue mass was revealed by magnetic resonance imaging. There was no lung metastasis. The patient received antalgic vertebral radiotherapy with systemic palliative chemotherapy consisting of oral cyclophosphamide. One year later, he died of progressive disease and multiorgan failure.

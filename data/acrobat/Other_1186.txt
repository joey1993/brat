The patient is a 45-year-old male. He was hypertensive and undergoing treatment since 2009. He was overweight (body mass index, 29.6), a smoker and dyslipidaemic. In 2012, he underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty plus stenting for unstable angina and underwent a further new percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in 2013. The same year, he was admitted to the Hypertension Unit of the University of Pisa for uncontrolled hypertension (office BP, 240/150 mm Hg and day-time ambulatory BP monitoring 200/102 mm Hg). Secondary causes of hypertension were ruled out. After several drug changes, the patient was treated with furosemide 50 mg/d, metoprolol 100 mg/d, spironolactone 50 mg/d, ramipril 10 mg/d, and amlodipine 10 mg/d without BP control. In March 2014, he underwent radiofrequency renal denervation without complications, but no significant BP reduction. Seven months later, he underwent baroreflex-activating therapy with office systolic BP reduction of â‰ˆ5 to 7 mm Hg. In January 2015, when he was visited at our Hypertension unit for the first time, his therapy consisted of 5 drug classes plus baroreflex-activating therapy. Office BP values were 210/150 mm Hg, 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring was 181/123 mm Hg. He was having continuous headache. Serum and urine therapeutic drug monitoring excluded malingering. 4 Biochemical and instrumental evaluation showed severe cardiac and renal target organ damage. We unsuccessfully modified his oral therapy as follows: telmisartan 80 mg/d, furosemide 75 mg/d, spironolactone 50 mg/d, nicardipine 60 mg/d, bisoprolol 10 mg/d, and minoxidi 10 mg/d. Thus, we started an intravenous infusion of urapidil at a dose of 6 mg/h to 10 mg/h that gave significant headache relief and a perception of well-being during the following days. After obtaining the patient's informed consent, we operated and performed a long-term intravenous antihypertensive treatment. First, the stability of urapidil in an elastomeric pump for a 10-day period was investigated and confirmed in the Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetics of our Department. Then, a PICC was inserted in the basilic vein using ultrasound guidance. Twenty-three vials of urapidil solution 50 mg/10 mL plus 45 mL of sodium chloride (NaCl 0.9%) were inserted in an elastomeric pump for large infusions with flux regulation Autoselector 275 mL (with an infusion rate ranging from 0.5 to 7 mL/h), to obtain an urapidil concentration of 4 mg/mL. The patient began the urapidil infusion at a rate of 8 mg/h (2 mL/h for a 5-day infusion) and, he was dismissed with the usual and above described antihypertensive oral treatment. The infusion was renewed every 5 days in the outpatient clinic together with PICC medications. Therapeutic drug monitoring of oral antihypertensive drugs was serially repeated and malingering excluded. The 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring values before and after 3 months are shown in The infusion has been maintained for

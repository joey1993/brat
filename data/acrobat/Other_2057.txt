In September 2012, a 68-years-old female patient was admitted to a General University Hospital for abdominal and back pain. The pain was increasing gradually for a week, with maximum in the right upper quadrant and irradiation into the
–, Leu), and high C-reactive protein 220 mg/l (reference = 0–7 mg/l, CRP). Abdominal ultrasound showed solitary bile stone and signs of acute exacerbation of chronic cholecystitis (irregular thickening of the gallbladder wall up to 9.5 mm with increased echogenicity), liver steatosis, and aortic aneurysm 32×30 mm in diameter. Therefore, she was treated for acute exacerbation of chronic cholecystitis by cephalosporin antibiotics (cefoperazone, Cefobid ® , Pfizer, Czech Republic, 2 g every 12 hours i.v.). However, this treatment had no influence on her symptoms and laboratory markers of inflammation were increasing (CRP 315 mg/l, Leu 16.7×10 9 /l). Blood cultures were negative, but serology identified acute Salmonella enteritis infection. CT of abdomen was requested to rule out complications. It showed moderate thickening of the gallbladder wall outlined by a thin rim of fluid consistent with the previously stated diagnosis. More importantly, the juxtarenal aneurysm previously identified by ultrasound substantially increased in size (diameter = 72×51 mm, length = 66 mm) and became saccular in shape . Its wall was thick (up to 7.4 mm), indistinct, blurred with stranding of the adjacent retroperitoneal fat and signs of past leakage. One week after admission, the patient was referred to the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery for juxtarenal infectious (mycotic) aneurysm. Because implantation of a stentgraft into an infectious aneurysm would pose a high risk of infection of the prosthetic material, we decided to perform replacement of the diseased segment by an allograft. The fresh allograft was available five days later.

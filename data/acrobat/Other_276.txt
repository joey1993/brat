A 37-year-old male presented with acute chest and back pain and was transferred to a local hospital where he was diagnosed with acute aortic dissection Stanford type B extending from the aortic arch to the bilateral common iliac arteries. He initially received medical treatment, but during the following 2 months the distal aortic arch gradually expanded to 51 and the thoracoabdominal aorta to 60 mm , and the patient was referred to our institute for surgical treatment. On the basis of computed tomographic angiography (CTA) findings, we opted for one-stage subtotal aortic repair for extensive aortic aneurysm. Preoperative CTA and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) findings led us to suspect that the feeding artery of the Adamkiewicz artery (AKA) was the right 12th intercostal artery, but the connection between AKA and the intercostal artery could not be clearly identified.

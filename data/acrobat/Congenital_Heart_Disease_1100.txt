We present the case of a 63 years old Caucasian female, referred to our echocardiography lab for routine evaluation 5 years after chemotherapy including cyclophosphamid and stem cell transplantation for chronic myeloid leukemia. She was in good general condition and asymptomatic. Physical examination, electrocardiography, prior thoracic X-ray and CT-scan were unremarkable. On trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE), performed with a Philips iE33, a DOMV could be detected in standard 2-dimensional views without stenosis or regurgitation ( , b, e and f, Additional file 1: Movie 1, Additional file 2: Movie 2, Additional file 3: Movie 3, Additional file 4: Movie 4 and Additional file 6: Movie 6). We classified the DOMV as a complete bridge type with a fibrous bridge separating the valve into two orifices with a slightly larger anterolateral orifice. Each orifice had its own leaflets and subvalvular apparatus, each connected to one papillary muscle resulting in a double parachute appearance in apical views ( and b, Additional file 1: Movie 1, Additional file 2: Movie 2 and Additional file 3: Movie 3). Two separate jets of antegrade flow into the left ventricle were detected with color Doppler flow ( and f, Additional file 5: Movie 5 and Additional file 6: Movie 6). We furthermore evaluated the valve with three dimensional TTE ( and d, Additional file 4: Movie 4), illustrating the relative dimensions of the two orifices. Interestingly, no other congenital cardiac anomaly or structural cardiopathy was found. In the absence of cardiac symptoms in this patient with a DOMV with normal function no further diagnostic or therapeutic steps were necessary. The patient was instructed to return to our clinic if any symptoms should evolve.

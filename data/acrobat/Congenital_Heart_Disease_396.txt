Patient 2 is the 12-year-old sister of patient 1. She was born at term by normal delivery. At birth, the weight was 2,600 g (10–25th centile), the length 48 cm (25–50th centile) and the head circumference 33 cm (25 – 50th centile). The neonatal echocardiography showed a 4-mm atrial septal defect, ostium secundum type, and mild pulmonary valve stenosis. At 3 months, a sigmoidoscopy carried out for rectorrhagia revealed lymphoid nodular hyperplasia of the sigmoid colon. Based on the hypothesis of Noonan syndrome, a molecular analysis was made and the pathogenic mutation c.922A>G (Asn308Asp) in the PTPN11 gene was found. The mutation was absent in the parental DNA and in the brother. On ophthalmological evaluation, astigmatism and hypermetropia were noted. Subsequently, psoriasis and keratosis pilaris and insulin resistance with a homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance of 8.5 were also observed. She had an expressive language delay and a borderline IQ on psychometric evaluation. Laboratory data showed prolonged PT (R 1.40; normal values 0.86–1.14) with mild deficiency of FX and FVII (0.46 and 0.61 IU/ml, respectively) and normal values of FII, FXI, FXII, and FXIII. At 6 years of age, her features were compatible with Noonan syndrome. At 12 years of age, her height was 148 cm (90th centile), weight 59 kg (BMI 26.8) and OFC 54 cm (90th centile).

An asymptomatic patient presented with a 2/6 grade holosystolic apical cardiac murmur on routine physical examination. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated QAV with cusps of equal size ( , upper and middle images), mild AR and a small restrictive muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) ( , lower image). Cardiac MRI (CMR) was performed to further assess the anatomy of the aortic valve, VSD, presence of extracardiac anomalies and to calculate the shunt fraction through the VSD. CMR confirmed type A QAV ( , upper and middle images) with mild AR (arrows, online supplementary video 1) and a small muscular VSD ( , lower image). Qp:Qs was 1.2 and no other coexisting extracardiac abnormalities could be seen. At this stage no active treatment was indicated but regular follow-up was recommended so that the QAV could be monitored to allow early recognition of any functional deterioration such as worsening AR.

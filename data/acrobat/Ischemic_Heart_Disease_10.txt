A 45-year-old diabetic and hypertensive man presented with a 4-year history of chest pain and an anterior wall myocardial infarction 2 months previously. Chest radiography revealed levorotation of the heart , electrocardiography suggested an old anterior wall myocardial infarction, echocardiography showed good left ventricular function, and coronary angiography demonstrated total cut-off in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) with retrograde filling. Offpump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) with a left internal mammary artery (LIMA)-to-LAD graft was planned. After sternotomy, a large pericardial defect involving the entire anterior and left lateral part was encountered. The left mediastinal pleura was also absent. Consequently, the heart was levorotated with the cardiac apex displaced into the left pleural cavity. The left phrenic nerve was embedded in fat between the left lung and the heart . Because of the absent pericardium, stay sutures to lift up the heart could not be placed. However, elevation was achieved by carefully placing 4 folded swabs below the left ventricle. With this maneuver, the levorotation of heart was corrected, and it was lifted sufficiently to apply an external stabilizing device and perform LIMA-to-LAD grafting. After removal of the stabilizer and swabs, the levorotation caused an angulation of theLIMA against the lung, which was relieved by further proximal dissection of the LIMA.

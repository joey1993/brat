History A 50-year-old male suffered from four episodes of predominantly right hemispheric stroke over a 2-week period in 2004. As an immediate consequence of the cerebrovascular accident, he developed severe left-sided weakness and pain. Although his physical symptoms recovered following 5 months of rehabilitation, his central post-stroke pain (CPSP) persisted despite trialing a variety of medications under several pain management programmes. His pain was dysaesthetic in nature and involved the lower part of his left face, neck and whole of the left trunk including the left arm and leg. Pre-operatively his medications included pregabalin, nitrazepam, nortriptyline, aspirin and dipyridamole. Given his HIV status, he was also on anti-retroviral medication with a steady viral load of 40 copies/ml and a CD4 count of 1145 cells/Î¼l. As his pain severity had not improved over a 7-year period, described as 10/10 by the patient despite therapy, and had limited his capacity to perform normal daily tasks, a right-sided unilateral thalamic DBS was offered and undertaken. An MRI brain scan revealed established infarctions predominantly in the right hemisphere involving the right thalamus, right posteromedial temporal and right antero-inferior occipital lobes, left posterior insula and left corona radiata. There was no significant damage to the right VP thalamus .
The patient has consented to the submission of the case report for submission to the journal.

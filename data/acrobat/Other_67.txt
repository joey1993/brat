A 60-year-old man presented with dyspnea and painful plaques on the lower extremities, which progressed slowly within two months. He was using antihypertensive drugs and had never consulted a physician for his varicose leg veins. The patient was a smoker and a habitual drinker. He had no history of connective tissue disease, Beh√ßet's disease, infection or trauma. On physical examination, expirium was prolonged. Blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg. There were multiple, 2x4 cm erythematous indurated plaques on his distal lower legs. Multiple varices located bilaterally on the posterior aspect of his knee, around his ankle and on the medial side of his feet were identifi ed . Laboratory fi ndings were in normal ranges. The patient was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by the specialist in chest diseases. Superfi cial venous insuffi ciency at the saphenoefemoral junction was observed by colored Doppler ultrasonography. Histopathology of the punch biopsy revealed slight infi ltration of mononuclear cells and fi brosis in the dermis, septa and fat lobules. The walls of the vessels were thickened and infi ltrated by lymphohistiocytes. There were multiple cysts of irregular shape and variable size in the adipose tissue: the cysts were lined by an amorphous eosinophilic material . Eosinophilic membranes were observed projecting into the cystic spaces (Figures 2B and 2C). The patient was diagnosed with membranous lipodystrophy due to vascular ischemia.
